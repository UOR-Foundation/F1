F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 57** (`CoSupportSubspace.lean`): **THE CO-SUPPORT
LEVELS ARE GENUINE LINEAR SUBSPACES** — closed under every linear operation the test algebra
has, not only under addition.

Brick 22's `hatVanishes_add` established closure under `+` at a shared decay constant. On
compact support the rest follows cleanly, because there the predicate *is* moment-vanishing
(`hatVanishes_of_moments`) and the moment map is linear:

    `HatVanishes (−φ) K`                (`hatVanishes_neg`)
    `HatVanishes (φ − ψ) K`             (`hatVanishes_sub`)
    `HatVanishes (k·φ) K`               (`hatVanishes_natScale`)
    `HatVanishes (φ + ψ) K`             (`hatVanishes_add_supp`, the compact restatement)

with the support side closed alongside (`unitSupported_neg`, `_add`, `_sub`; `natScale_supp` was
brick 35's).

WHY IT MATTERS (the Sonine route). The coupling step 4 would have to act on a *space*, so it
matters that each level is one — and that its realized inhabitants are not isolated points. The
payoff here is `combo345_in_level_three`: EVERY natural-coefficient combination
`a·deep3 + b·deep4 + c·deep5` lies in level `3`. With brick 55 (those three are independent as
far as the moment functionals at `3,4,5` see them) each realized level carries an infinite,
genuinely multi-dimensional family rather than one witness and its multiples.

HONEST SCOPE. Closure under the linear operations, on the compact-support branch where the decay
constant is `0`; the general shared-`C` statement is brick 22's addition only. Nothing here
touches the Weil form. Step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
