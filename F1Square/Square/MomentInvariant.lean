F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 47** (`MomentInvariant.lean`): **THE MOMENT ENERGY IS
A MOMENT-INVARIANT** — `momentL2Sq φ` depends only on the moment sequence, not on the particular
test that produced it:

    `(∀ n, ⟨φ, xⁿ⟩ ≈ ⟨ψ, xⁿ⟩)  ⟹  momentL2Sq φ ≈ momentL2Sq ψ`   (`momentL2Sq_congr`).

This is the well-definedness the `ℓ²` norm needs to be a norm *on the moment sequence* rather than
an artifact of the construction: the norm was built through an index rescale keyed to the test's
own bound `M_φ` (`momScale φ`), and a priori two tests with the same moments but different `M`
read their limits along different schedules. This brick shows the value is the same regardless —
the rescale is scaffolding, not content.

The proof is brick 45 used both ways. Equal moments give equal partial energies
(`momentSqSum_congr`, one `RsumN_congr`), so each rescaled read of `φ`'s energy equals a partial
energy of `ψ`'s, which brick 45 bounds by `momentL2Sq ψ`; `Rlim_le_const` then gives
`momentL2Sq φ ≤ momentL2Sq ψ`, and symmetry closes the equality. The capstone adds a second
certified nonzero energy: `bumpU = x(1−x)` has zeroth moment `1/6`, so `Pos (momentL2Sq bumpU)`.

HONEST SCOPE. Well-definedness of the `ℓ²` moment energy for bounded-Lipschitz tests on `[0,1]`,
nothing about the Weil form. Step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
