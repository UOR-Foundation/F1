F1 square — **the ACCELERATED angle target: repairing the certificate route's closing mechanism**
(`AngleTargetAcc.lean`). `AngleTargetBound.lean` proved the raw target's satisfiability gap
(`angleDiagTarget_Rlim_le_two`: `reg` forces `Rlim ≤ 2`, incompatible with `hid : Rlim = 2λₙ ~ n log n`).
The fix: reindex the raw partial sums by a monotone schedule `sched`,

    `angleDiagTargetAcc θ n sched j := angleDiagTarget θ n (sched j)`.

For `sched 0 > 0` the accelerated sequence starts from a LARGE partial (`Y_0 = angleDiagTarget θ n
(sched 0) ≠ 0`), so `RReg` no longer caps the limit at `2` — `reg'` (regularity of the accelerated
target) and `hid` (`Rlim = 2λₙ`) become JOINTLY SATISFIABLE. The closing theorem's proof is
target-agnostic (it only consumes `hid`/`hpos`, never the target's shape), so it transfers verbatim to
the accelerated target — with hypotheses that can actually be met on the genuine, unbounded `2λₙ`.

This is the repair `AngleTargetBound.lean` named: it makes `atlasAngleFamily_closes_crux` INSTANTIABLE.
It still constructs no `θ`, no `sched`, and asserts nothing about the genuine `2λₙ` (that identity is
`hid`, which is RH). Discharging `reg'` for a sum-converging `θ` (choosing `sched` fast enough that the
accelerated partials are canonical-rate Cauchy) is separate convergence analysis; here `reg'` is an
explicit hypothesis, exactly as `reg` was — but now on a target where it does not contradict `hid`.

HONEST SCOPE. The accelerated closing reduction, with `reg'` compatible with an unbounded limit. It
repairs a formalization defect; it does NOT close the crux. The crux fields stay `none`.

    `angleDiagTargetAcc θ n sched j = angleDiagTarget θ n (sched j)`. With `sched 0 > 0` it starts from a

    `angleDiagTargetAcc`, whose `reg` does NOT cap the limit at `2` and so is jointly satisfiable with
    `hid : Rlim = 2λₙ` on the genuine, unbounded data. NOTHING here constructs `θ`/`sched` or asserts
    the identity/strictness for the genuine `2λₙ` — that is RH; the crux fields stay `none`. -/
