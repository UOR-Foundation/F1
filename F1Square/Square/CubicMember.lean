F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 27** (`CubicMember.lean`): **THE NONZERO CO-SUPPORT
SUBSPACE MEMBER** — a genuine nonzero `[0,1]`-supported test INSIDE `HatVanishes · 1`: the
co-support subspace is inhabited beyond zero.

The member is the cubic bump `cubeBump = bumpU·(1 − 2·clamp)` (`x(1−x)(1−2x)` on `[0,1]`,
vanishing beyond), realized by the test-algebra combinators alone. Its zeroth moment is
`∫₀¹ x(1−x)(1−2x) = (1/2 − 1/3) − (2/3 − 1/2) = 0`, delivered by the three engine values
(bricks 23/24/26) through the integral's additive-group structure at one shared modulus. The
integrand expands pointwise to the certified test's EXACT shape
`(c − c²) − ((c² + c²) − (c³ + c³))` — the expansion tree is chosen to match the derivation,
so no add/neg reshuffle (which the reindexing Bishop `Radd` does not admit at the seq level)
is ever needed.

- `cubeBump_supp` — unit support (the `bumpU` factor kills every window point).
- `mellinMoment_cubeBump` — the zeroth moment vanishes EXACTLY.
- **`cubeBump_hatVanishes`** — through the brick-22 moment bridge, `cubeBump` IS in the
  co-support class at `K = 1`.
- **`cubeBump_value_quarter`/`cubeBump_apart`** — `f(1/4) ≈ 3/32` and `Pos (f(1/4))`: the
  member is APART from the zero function at a witnessed point.

With brick 25 (`bumpU ∉ HatVanishes · 1`) the picture is complete: the transform-side
vanishing condition cuts out a subspace that is proper AND contains a certified nonzero
member — the co-support geometry is genuinely realized on constructed objects.

HONEST SCOPE. One nonzero member at `K = 1` (one vanishing transform value); deeper `K`
(more vanishing moments) needs higher-degree evaluations; no continuous parameter, no
band-indexed tie to `bandProj`, no coupling — positivity on the co-support class is step 4
and is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`.
