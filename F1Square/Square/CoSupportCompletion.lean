F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 48** (`CoSupportCompletion.lean`): **THE SKELETON'S
POSITIVITY FIRES ON THE COMPLETED `ℓ²` MEMBER** — the co-support result moves off finite moment
data and onto the truncation-uniform limit object the completion axis constructs.

`weil_psd_on_cosupport` (brick 29) fires the skeleton's unconditional positivity on `momSeq φ`,
the moment sequence read as a coefficient family. Bricks 43–44 then built that sequence as a
genuine completion: the quadratically rescaled moment cuts are `SqCauchyU`, their truncation-
uniform limit member exists, and it *is* `momSeq φ`. This brick draws the consequence —

    `Rnonneg (weilQuad (multForm burnolMult) (limMemberU (momIdx φ) _) N)`
      (`weil_psd_on_completed_cosupport`)

for every `[0,1]`-supported test whose transform vanishes at `0, 1`, at every truncation `N`.
The band hypothesis is discharged, not assumed: the completed member's band coordinate is the
test's first moment (brick 44), and the co-support condition kills it
(`limMemberU_momIdx_band_zero`).

WHY IT IS NOT A RESTATEMENT. `sonine_complement_complete` (brick 16) already carried the
skeleton's positivity through a completion, but for a *fixed-truncation* limit member of an
abstract band-vanishing Cauchy family. Here the family is not abstract — it is the moment data
of a constructed test — the member is *truncation-uniform*, the convergence is strong at every
truncation (`momIdx_converges_to_momSeq`), and, crucially, the member is not the zero sequence:
`deep3` has `Pos (momentL2Sq deep3)` (brick 45), so `completed_cosupport_nonzero` records that
the positivity here fires on completed data of certified nonzero `ℓ²` energy.

HONEST SCOPE. Still the discrete diagonal-multiplier form on moment data — now at the completion
level. It is NOT the Weil functional on the test space, and NOT positivity beyond the
complement: that is step 4, which is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
