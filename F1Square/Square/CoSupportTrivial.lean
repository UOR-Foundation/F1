F1 square — **the co-support filtration intersection is trivial** (`CoSupportTrivial.lean`), sub-brick
M₁. The co-support object `HatVanishes φ K` was shown proper, strict through depth 8, inhabited for
`K = 1..7`, thin at rate `1/(K+1)`. This brick pins its intersection:

  `(∀ K, φ ∈ HatVanishes·K)  ⟹  φ ≈ 0 on [0,1]`   (`hatVanishes_all_imp_zero`),

i.e. `⋂_K HatVanishes·K = {0}` — a unit-supported test orthogonal to *every* monomial `xⁿ` is zero on
`[0,1]`. Equivalently, the **monomial system is total** in the L² sense: the dual of L² density
(`bernOp_L2_converges` — polynomials dense) is that nothing nonzero is orthogonal to all of them.

The weld is immediate on the substrate: each level condition unfolds
(`hatVanishes_iff_orthogonal`) to `⟨φ,xⁿ⟩ ≈ 0` for `n < K`; taking `K = i+1` makes every moment
`mellinMoment φ i = ⟨φ, xⁱ⟩` vanish (definitionally `innerI φ (powTest i)`), and general moment
determinacy (`moment_determinacy_unit`, the completed Bernstein arc) closes.

WHY (the Sonine route, step 3, the co-support object). Density (approximation) and totality
(determinacy) are the two halves of the monomial system's completeness in `L²[0,1]`: the polynomials
are dense, and the filtration of orthogonal-complements collapses to `{0}`. Both are now theorems, on
the general bounded-Lipschitz class.

HONEST SCOPE. A determinacy corollary about the co-support filtration of a single unit-supported test.
NOT a completed L² space of functions, NOT surjectivity onto function space, NOT positivity beyond the
complement. Step 4 is RH; crux fields stay `none`.
