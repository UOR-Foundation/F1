F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 53** (`CoSupportPairing.lean`): **DEEP CO-SUPPORT IS
NEARLY ORTHOGONAL TO EVERYTHING** — brick 42's diagonal rate, generalized to the bilinear
pairing:

    `φ ∈ HatVanishes · K   ⟹   |⟪φ, ψ⟫|  ≤  2·M_φ·M_ψ/(K+1)`   for EVERY `ψ`
      (`crossMomL2_abs_le_of_hatVanishes`).

Brick 42 said a depth-`K` member carries little moment *energy* — `‖φ̂‖² ≤ 2M_φ²/(K+1)` — which
is the case `ψ = φ`. This says the same member is nearly orthogonal to the whole space, at the
same rate, with a bound linear in each test's own `M`. Taking `ψ` to range over the constructed
members, the deep levels of the filtration are not merely thin, they are nearly perpendicular to
everything the layer can pair them against.

The proof is the co-support condition eating the head of the series. Below `K` the `φ`-moments
vanish, so every cross partial sum is *literally* a window from the cut `K`
(`crossMomSum_zero_below`, `crossMomSum_eq_window`), and brick 49's window bound —
Cauchy–Schwarz against the two tails, whose product is the exact square of the rational
`2M_φM_ψ/(K+1)` — applies uniformly in the window length. The limit then inherits the bound from
both sides exactly as in brick 50.

HONEST SCOPE. A rate for the `ℓ²` moment pairing of bounded-Lipschitz tests on `[0,1]` in terms
of one side's co-support depth. Nothing here touches the Weil form, and it says nothing about
whether a nonzero test can have all moments vanish (determinacy, still untouched). Step 4 is RH.
The crux fields stay `none`.
