F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 16** (`CompleteComplement.lean`): **THE SONINE
COMPLEMENT IS CLOSED UNDER COMPLETION** — band-vanishing Cauchy sequences have band-vanishing
limits, and the skeleton's unconditional positivity survives the passage to limit members.

- `limMember_band_zero` — if every `F j` vanishes on the negative-band index (`F j 1 ≈ 0`),
  then so does the constructed limit member: the band coordinate of the limit is the Bishop
  limit of the band coordinates (`fourierC_indic` + `Rlim_zero`).
- **`sonine_complement_complete`** — the payoff, unconditional: for every band-vanishing
  `dist2`-Cauchy sequence, the Weil multiplier pairing of the LIMIT member is `≥ 0` at every
  truncation — `burnol_pairing_psd_on_sonine` applied to the constructed limit. The Sonine
  complement (the skeleton subspace where positivity is a theorem) is a COMPLETE subspace:
  positivity is not lost in the limit.

WHY (the Sonine route, steps 3–4). This closes the loop between the completion arc (bricks
13–15) and the skeleton dichotomy (`SonineProjection`): the projection subspace is complete
and positivity passes to its limits — so what step 4 must supply is EXACTLY the coupling
beyond this closed subspace, not any limit bookkeeping inside it. The localization sharpens:
the band-coupling content is not hiding in the completion.

HONEST SCOPE. Closure and positivity for the SKELETON's band condition under fixed-truncation
completion; nothing about the genuine `f, f̂` co-support coupling, whose positivity beyond the
complement is step 4 and is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`.
