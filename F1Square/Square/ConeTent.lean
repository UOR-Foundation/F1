F1 square — **THE FIRST CONE-SHAPED TEST DATUM WITH A LIVE PRIME SIDE** (`ConeTent.lean`):
the square-scale symmetric log-tent

    `t4F(x) = 2·log 2 − |log x|` on `[1/4, 4]`, `0` outside

realized as a genuine `WeilTest` (`X = 4`), with its finite-place side EVALUATED in closed
form (`t4PrimePart_eq`): the primes `2` and `3` and the prime power `4` all sit inside the
support, and

    `primes(t4) ≈ log 2·(log 2 + ½·log 2) + log 3·((2·log 2 − log 3) + ⅓·(2·log 2 − log 3))`
    (`= (3/2)·(log 2)² + (4/3)·log 3·(2·log 2 − log 3) ≈ 1.1421`;
     the `Λ(4) = log 2` term dies on the knot `f(4) = 0`).

WHY THIS SHAPE. In the logarithmic variable `u = log x` the test is the tent
`max(0, 2·log 2 − |u|)` — the AUTOCORRELATION of the box on `[−log 2, log 2]`, i.e. of the
box with RATIONAL knots `[1/2, 2]` in `x`. This kills the `√2` obstruction recorded against
the scale-2 tent (whose generating box has knots `2^{∓1/2}`): at SQUARE scales `X = c²` the
generating box `[1/c, c]` is rational-knot. So `t4F` is the first realized test datum of
autocorrelation SHAPE — the cone `g ⋆ g^τ` is where the Weil criterion demands positivity
(`W(bump) < 0` certified that off-cone tests can be negative), and `f(1) = 2·log 2 > 0`
(`t4F_one`) is the on-cone marker `∫|g|² > 0` that the off-cone bump lacked. The datum is
log-VALUED at rational points (`f(a/b) = 2·log 2 ∓ (log a − log b)`), which `WeilTest`
carries natively (`f : Q → Real`).

HONEST SCOPE. This realizes the test DATUM and its finite-place side. The slot integrals
(poles, archimedean tail) need the certified `∫ log` layer — not yet built; and the exact
Connes–Consani weight normalization of the cone element (whether the pairing's `g ⋆ g^τ`
carries an additional multiplicative weight in `x`) is deliberately NOT asserted here —
`t4F` is claimed as the log-coordinate autocorrelation shape only. No positivity claim; the
crux fields stay `none`.
