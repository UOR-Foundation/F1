F1 square — **the moment problem is well-posed** (`MomentProblemWellPosed.lean`), the capstone of the
moment-realization sub-arc. It packages the two halves the sub-arc built — conditional *existence* and
completion-level *uniqueness* — into the single statement they were aiming at: a rational sequence
carrying a Bessel modulus is the moment sequence of a **unique** completed `L²` element.

  `besselSeq_realizes_unique`   :  any `L²` element with the same moments as the realized one equals it;
  `moment_problem_wellposed`    :  existence ∧ uniqueness — `μ` (with a rational Bessel modulus) is
                                   realized by the completed element `E`, and every completed element
                                   with those moments is `E`.

Existence is `besselSeq_realizes_of_modulus` (the coda's conditional realization); uniqueness is
`L2Elt_moment_eq_imp_eq` (the completion-level injectivity of the moment map, already proved via the
completed Bernstein arc). The composition is a two-line splice — no new analysis — but it is the honest
headline: the moment map is a *bijection* between valid rational sequences (those carrying the modulus)
and completed `L²` elements, the constructive Hausdorff moment theorem for this class.

HONEST SCOPE. **Conditional**, unchanged: existence rests on the supplied rational Bessel modulus (an
audit-visible hypothesis, never an axiom, never asserted for a particular `μ`); uniqueness is
unconditional. This well-posedness is classical measure-theoretic content about the *moment map*, NOT
surjectivity onto arbitrary sequences, and NOT positivity of any crux form. Step 4 (band-coupling
positivity) is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.
