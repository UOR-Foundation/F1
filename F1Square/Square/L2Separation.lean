F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 80** (`L2Separation.lean`): **THE `L²` INNER PRODUCT
SEPARATES POINTS OF `[0,1]`** — two tests at `L²` distance zero agree at every point of the unit
interval:

    `dist2I φ ψ ≈ 0`,  `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`   ⟹   `φ(x) ≈ ψ(x)`   (`dist2I_zero_imp_pointwise_eq`).

This is the immediate payoff of brick 79's point-definiteness, applied to the difference test:
`dist2I φ ψ = ⟨φ−ψ, φ−ψ⟩` (`PairingLimitI`), so `dist2I φ ψ ≈ 0` forces `(φ−ψ)(x) ≈ 0` at every
point of `[0,1]` (brick 79), and `(φ−ψ)(x) = φ(x) − ψ(x)` (definitionally, `L2Test.sub` is
`add _ (neg _)`), so `φ(x) ≈ ψ(x)`. What it buys is that the `L²` seminorm is a genuine
*separating* form on `[0,1]`: two tests the pairing cannot tell apart are the same function there,
so the `L²` class injects into the values on `[0,1]`. This is the sense in which the completion
axis (`pairingLim`, `dist2I`, brick 62's `L²` completeness) is a *pre-Hilbert* structure and not
merely a semi-normed one — the null relation is pointwise equality on `[0,1]`, not a coarser
identification.

HONEST SCOPE. One direction only, and on `[0,1]` only. `dist2I φ ψ ≈ 0 ⟹ φ, ψ agree on `[0,1]``;
the converse (agree on `[0,1]` ⟹ `dist2I ≈ 0`) is the integral-of-a-vanishing-integrand direction,
which the certified integral's generic congruence lemmas state over *all* reals and which is in
fact false off `[0,1]` (the integral does not see values outside the interval) — so it needs a
`[0,1]`-restricted argument not performed here. This is separation, i.e. injectivity of the `L²`
class into functions on `[0,1]`, NOT a full isometry, and NOT the moment problem (a nonzero test
with every *moment* vanishing is a different, still-open question). Nothing here touches the Weil
form. Step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
