F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 42** (`CoSupportEnergy.lean`): **DEEP CO-SUPPORT
MEANS SMALL MOMENT ENERGY** — a quantitative statement about the filtration, with the rate:

    `φ ∈ HatVanishes · K   ⟹   ‖φ̂‖² = Σ_n ⟨φ, xⁿ⟩²  ≤  2·M_φ²/(K+1)`

(`momentL2Sq_le_of_hatVanishes`), and in the limit of full co-support — every moment vanishing —
the energy is exactly zero (`momentL2Sq_zero_of_moments`).

The proof is the two bricks before it doing their job together. Membership at depth `K` kills
the head of the sum outright (`momentSqSum_zero`: the first `K` terms are literally zero), so
every partial sum IS a tail, and brick 39's uniform tail bound `2M²/(N+1)` read at `N = K`
bounds all of them at once (`momentSqSum_le_of_moments`, by cases on `N ≤ K` or `N = K + d`).
Brick 40's `Rlim` then inherits the bound termwise through `Rlim_le_ofQ` — no epsilon argument,
because the bound is uniform in the index rather than approached in the limit.

WHY IT MATTERS (the Sonine route). The co-support tower does not collapse (bricks 36–37, 41):
each level is properly smaller. This brick says *how much* smaller in the one quantity the
layer can measure — the levels are thin in moment energy, at rate `1/(K+1)`. A test constrained
to vanish deep into the monomial band carries correspondingly little moment data, which is the
finite shadow of why the genuine `f, f̂` coupling has to be an infinite-dimensional phenomenon
rather than a finite computation.

HONEST SCOPE. A rate for the moment energy of a bounded-Lipschitz test on `[0,1]`, in terms of
its co-support depth. Nothing here bounds the Weil functional, and nothing here says a nonzero
test with all moments vanishing does or does not exist (that is the determinacy question, not
touched). Step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
