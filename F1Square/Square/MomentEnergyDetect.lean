F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 45** (`MomentEnergyDetect.lean`): **THE ENERGY
DETECTS THE MOMENTS** — the "from the limit" companion to brick 42, supplying the direction the
completion layer previously lacked:

    `⟨φ, xⁿ⟩²  ≤  ‖φ̂‖² = momentL2Sq φ`   for every `n`   (`mellinMoment_sq_le_momentL2Sq`),

so **any moment that is apart from zero forces the energy apart from zero**
(`momentL2Sq_pos_of_moment`). Brick 42 bounded the energy from ABOVE by a co-support depth;
this brick bounds it from BELOW by every single squared moment, and the two directions together
say the energy sees exactly the moment data.

The enabling lemma is that a partial energy sits below the total: `momentSqSum φ N ≤ momentL2Sq φ`
(`momentSqSum_le_momentL2Sq`). This is the `X k ≤ lim X` direction — available because the
rescaled partial sums are monotone, so `term_le_Rlim` applies; a `≤ Rlim` from a fixed term was
the one comparison the completion axis did not yet have (`Rlim_le_ofQ` and friends only bound the
limit from above). Every partial sum then reaches the limit through the rescaled index
(`N ≤ momScale·(N+1)`, monotonicity), and a single squared moment reaches it through
`⟨φ,xⁿ⟩² ≤ momentSqSum φ (n+1)` (the tail of the sum is nonnegative).

The capstone realizes it: the constructed `K = 3` member `deep3` has third moment `−1/2520`,
apart from zero, so `Pos (momentL2Sq deep3)` — a certified NONZERO moment energy, consistent
with `deep3` being a genuinely nonzero test that is NOT full-co-support.

HONEST SCOPE. A lower bound on the `ℓ²` moment energy of a bounded-Lipschitz test by its
individual squared moments — still the compact `[0,1]` moment map, nothing about the Weil form.
It does not settle determinacy (whether a nonzero test can have ALL moments zero — that would
need `momentL2Sq φ = 0 → φ = 0`, i.e. a moment-problem uniqueness this does not provide). Step 4
is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
