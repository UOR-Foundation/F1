F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 85** (`CoSupportPairwise.lean`): **THE THREE FLAGSHIP
LEVEL-3 MEMBERS ARE PAIRWISE-DISTINCT FUNCTIONS ON `[0,1]`** — completing brick 84's technique
across all three pairs, so the moment-table independence (`deep345_independent`) is fully upgraded
to a function-level statement for the realized members.

Each pair differs in an explicit moment, which brick 84's bridge (`distinct_on_unit_of_moment_ne`)
turns into function-level distinctness:

    `deep3` vs `deep4` : `⟨·, x³⟩` is `−1/2520` vs `0`    (`deep3_deep4_distinct_on_unit`, brick 84)
    `deep3` vs `deep5` : `⟨·, x³⟩` is `−1/2520` vs `0`    (`deep3_deep5_distinct_on_unit`)
    `deep4` vs `deep5` : `⟨·, x⁴⟩` is `1/13860` vs `0`   (`deep4_deep5_distinct_on_unit`)

bundled as `deep345_pairwise_distinct_on_unit`. `deep5` (co-support level 5) vanishes through the
fourth moment, so it is separated from `deep3` (level 3, first nonzero moment at index 3) already at
index 3, and from `deep4` (level 4, first nonzero at index 4) at index 4.

HONEST SCOPE. Pairwise distinctness — each pair does **not** agree everywhere on `[0,1]` (the
constructive negation, not a constructed point of disagreement). This is weaker than function-level
linear independence of the triple (which would rule out every nontrivial `ℕ`-combination vanishing,
and for the `a = 0` combinations is not covered here). Realized members only. Nothing here touches
the Weil form; the co-support skeleton's positivity is still diagonal-multiplier level. Step 4 is RH.
The crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
