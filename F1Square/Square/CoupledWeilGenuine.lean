F1 square — **the coupled kernel welded to the genuine crux** (`CoupledWeilGenuine.lean`): connecting
the off-diagonal coupled Weil kernel to the program's central localization `atlas_crux_localization`,
so its strict diagonal dominance is tied to the GENUINE prime–archimedean coupling positivity, not a
generic induced square.

The coupled kernel's diagonal is `coupledWeil arch w v M (n,n) = arch n − primeGram(n,n)` — the Weil
value at index `n`. The explicit-formula identity is that this Weil value equals `2λₙ = −⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ =
Rneg (genuineSpectralSquare E).cSq n` (the pairing dictionary, `genuineSpectralSquare_dict`). Supplying
that identity as an EXPLICIT hypothesis `hmatch` (exactly the `realizesDiag_genuine_iff` discipline —
the diagonal match is the interface, never proven; proving it is the explicit formula), the coupled
kernel's strict diagonal dominance becomes the genuine crux:

  • `coupledWeil_diag_pos_iff_genuine_crux` — under `hmatch`, `(∀n>0, Pos (coupledWeil arch w v M n n))
    ⟺ SpectralCrux (genuineSpectralSquare E)` (a `Pos_congr` on the diagonal match; `SpectralCrux` is
    `Pos (−cSq)`).
  • `coupledWeil_diag_pos_iff_genuine_coupling` — chaining through `atlas_crux_localization`, under
    `hmatch` the strict diagonal dominance is EQUIVALENT to the genuine coupling positivity
    `∀n>0, Pos (genuineArithSeq E.eta n + genuineArchSeq n)` — THE crux.

HONEST SCOPE. `hmatch` (the coupled Weil diagonal equals `2λₙ`, the explicit-formula identity) is an
EXPLICIT hypothesis, never discharged — there is no instantiation of `arch, w, v` at the genuine `ζ`
data that proves it, and even with it the strict dominance is `SpectralCrux` = RH, never asserted. This
weld only routes the coupled kernel's face into the program's central crux equivalence; it discharges
nothing. Crux fields stay `none`.

/-- **★ THE EXPLICIT-FORMULA DECOMPOSITION, kernel-explicit**: under the diagonal match `hmatch`, the
    Li coefficient is exactly the archimedean multiplier MINUS the prime Gram diagonal —
    `2λₙ = arch n − primeGram(n,n)` for all `n > 0`. This is why `2λₙ` is not manifestly a sum of
    squares: its intrinsic expression is a DIFFERENCE of the two PSD-form diagonals (arch spectral,
    prime Gram), so a `RealizesDiag` Euclidean embedding (`gramOf ι D n n = 2λₙ`, a pure SOS) exists
    only when the arch diagonal dominates the prime — which is RH. Ties the coupled kernel (step 4) to
    the discharge form. `hmatch` is never discharged; the crux stays `none`. -/
