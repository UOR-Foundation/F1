F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 58** (`CoSupportFamily.lean`): **THE POSITIVITY FIRES
ON AN INFINITE FAMILY OF NONZERO CO-SUPPORT MEMBERS** — bricks 29 and 48 fired the skeleton's
unconditional positivity at single constructed members; brick 57 made the levels linear
subspaces; this brick draws the consequence at the whole realized family at once.

For every `a, b, c : ℕ` the combination `combo345 a b c = a·deep3 + b·deep4 + c·deep5` lies in
level `3`, so:

    `Rnonneg (weilQuad (multForm burnolMult) (momSeq (combo345 a b c)) N)`
      (`combo345_weil_psd`)
    `Rnonneg (weilQuad (multForm burnolMult) (limMemberU (momIdx (combo345 a b c)) _) N)`
      (`combo345_weil_psd_completed`)

at every truncation — the second at the truncation-uniform *completed* `ℓ²` member.

The family is not vacuous, and it is not vacuous uniformly: whenever `a ≥ 1` the member carries
strictly positive moment energy (`combo345_energy_pos`), because brick 55's table reads the
third moment off the first coefficient exactly — `⟨combo345 a b c, x³⟩ = −a/2520` — and brick 45
turns a nonzero moment into `Pos` energy. So the positivity above fires on infinitely many
genuinely nonzero members, indexed faithfully by `a`, and not on a family that might collapse to
the zero sequence.

HONEST SCOPE. Still the discrete diagonal-multiplier form on moment data, now over a realized
infinite family rather than single instances. It is NOT the Weil functional on the test space,
and NOT positivity beyond the complement — that is step 4, which is RH. The crux fields stay
`none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
