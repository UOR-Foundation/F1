F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 77** (`DyadicClamp.lean`): **THE CLAMPED DYADIC INDEX**
— the second piece brick 76 named as missing.

Brick 75's floor `⌊q·2^m⌋` lands in `[0, 2^m)` only when the rational `q` is already in `[0,1)`.
The rationals that arise in the density argument are the approximants `x.seq N` of a real
`x ∈ [0,1]`, and those need **not** be in range: they can dip below `0` or reach `1` by up to the
approximation error. So the index has to be clamped, and the clamp has to cost something bounded:

    `dyadJC q m := min (⌊q·2^m⌋) (2^m − 1)`,      `dyadJC q m < 2^m`   (`dyadJC_lt`).

The clamp is a `ℕ` `min` — decidable, no real compared to anything.

HONEST SCOPE. This brick supplies the clamped index and its range bound only. It does **not**
prove the approximation quality of the clamped point for an out-of-range `q` — that needs the
case analysis on `q` (below `0`, in range, at-or-above `1`), which is decidable but is arithmetic
this brick does not carry out. So `DyadicApproximable` is still **not discharged**, and brick 74's
definiteness remains stated at dyadic points. Nothing here touches the Weil form. The crux fields
stay `none`.
