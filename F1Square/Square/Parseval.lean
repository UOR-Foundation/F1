F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 11** (`Parseval.lean`): **PARSEVAL AT THE FULL
INDICATOR BASIS** — the finite-complete case where Bessel saturates.

Brick 3 proved Bessel: `Σ_{k<K} ⟨f,eₖ⟩² ≤ ⟨f,f⟩_N` for any orthonormal family. This brick proves
that at the FULL indicator basis (`K = N`, the basis the discrete Sonine skeleton lives on) the
inequality is an EQUALITY and the projection is the identity:

- `fourierC_indic` — the Fourier coefficients against the indicators are the coordinates:
  `⟨f, δₖ⟩_N ≈ f(k)` for `k < N` (sifting).
- `proj_indic_eq` — the projection onto the full indicator basis is the identity on the
  truncation: `(P f)(i) ≈ f(i)` for `i < N`.
- **`parseval_indic`** — `Σ_{k<N} ⟨f,δₖ⟩² ≈ ⟨f,f⟩_N`: Bessel is sharp at the complete basis.

WHY (the Sonine route, step 3). The layer's remaining lack is "completeness past finite support
(Parseval and the infinite-dimensional projection, versus Bessel at fixed truncation)". This
brick delivers the FINITE-complete half exactly: at every truncation the indicator basis is
complete and Parseval holds on the nose — so the infinite-dimensional gap is precisely what a
completion (and only a completion) would close, and the Bessel/Parseval boundary is now
kernel-checked rather than informal.

HONEST SCOPE. Parseval for the full finite indicator basis at a fixed truncation; NOT an
infinite-dimensional Parseval, NOT completeness — those need the completion axis, which remains
open and is fenced as such. The crux fields stay `none`.
