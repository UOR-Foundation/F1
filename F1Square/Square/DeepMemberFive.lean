F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 54** (`DeepMemberFive.lean`): **THE `K = 5`
CO-SUPPORT MEMBER**, extending the strict chain to `HatVanishes · 5 ⊋ HatVanishes · 6`.

Over brick 34's Gram closed form `⟨xⁱ, xʲ⟩ = 1/(i+j+1)` a depth-`K` member is a finite rational
linear system — `Σᵢ aᵢ/(i+n+1) = 0` for `n < K` together with the support condition `Σᵢ aᵢ = 0`.
At `K = 5`, over `i = 1..7`, the solution is `a = (1, −21, 140, −420, 630, −462, 132)`:

    `deep5 = x − 21x² + 140x³ − 420x⁴ + 630x⁵ − 462x⁶ + 132x⁷`.

Its first non-vanishing moment is read off the same Gram matrix — no new integration —

    `⟨deep5, x⁵⟩ = 748873/9009 − 665/8 = −1/72072 ≠ 0`,

so `deep5 ∈ HatVanishes · 5` and `deep5 ∉ HatVanishes · 6` (`cosupport_strict_at_five`), and with
bricks 37 and 41 the chain reads `0 ⊋ 1 ⊋ 2 ⊋ 3 ⊋ 4 ⊋ 5 ⊋ 6` (`cosupport_chain_strict_six`).
The member is apart from zero — `deep5(1/10) = −3843/625000`, so the APARTNESS witness is on the
negation, unlike every earlier member — and the capstone fires the skeleton's unconditional
positivity on it.

HONEST SCOPE. One more member, one more strict level. NOT a proof that every level is inhabited
or strict (that needs invertibility of the Hilbert sections in general), and the positivity is
still the skeleton's diagonal multiplier form on moment data — not the Weil functional on the
test space, and not positivity beyond the complement. Step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
