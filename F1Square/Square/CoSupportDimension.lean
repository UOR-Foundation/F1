F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 55** (`CoSupportDimension.lean`): **THE CO-SUPPORT
LEVELS ARE NOT ONE-DIMENSIONAL** — the level `HatVanishes · 3` carries a family of at least
dimension two, so its inhabitation is not the accident of a single witness and its multiples.

`deep3`, `deep4`, `deep5` all lie in level `3` (`deep345_in_level_three`), and the moment
functionals at `3, 4, 5` separate them in a TRIANGULAR pattern, every entry read off brick 34's
Hilbert matrix with no new integration:

    ⟨deep3,x³⟩ = −1/2520   ⟨deep4,x³⟩ = 0          ⟨deep5,x³⟩ = 0
    ⟨deep3,x⁴⟩ = −1/1260   ⟨deep4,x⁴⟩ = 1/13860    ⟨deep5,x⁴⟩ = 0
    ⟨deep3,x⁵⟩ = −1/924    ⟨deep4,x⁵⟩ = 1/5544     ⟨deep5,x⁵⟩ = −1/72072

(`cosupport_triangular_table`). Lower-triangular with nonzero diagonal, so coefficients can be
read off one at a time: `deep34_independent` does the first two — the `x³` moment sees only
`deep3`, and then the `x⁴` moment only `deep4`.

The extraction step is the reusable half. `nat_eq_zero_of_ofQ_zero` turns a vanishing constructed
real `ofQ ⟨a, d⟩ ≈ 0` back into the arithmetic fact `a = 0`: the substrate has no `ofQ`
injectivity lemma, so the honest route is to exhibit the `Pos` witness a nonzero `a` would supply
and collide it with `not_Pos_zero`. Its companion `nat_eq_zero_of_ofQ_neg_zero` handles the
negative entries, which here are most of them.

HONEST SCOPE. Independence over NATURAL-number coefficients, and here only for the first TWO of
the three members. (The third step is NOT blocked: brick 67 closes it in
`CoSupportDimThree.lean`, at the default elaboration budget. The claim previously recorded here —
that the `x⁵` identity's denominators `924·5544·72072` overrun the elaborator — was simply
wrong, and is retracted; the identity is linear in the coefficients, so `ring_uor` normalises it
in one pass.) So this file is a two-dimensionality result plus the full table, not a dimension
formula, not a basis, and nothing about levels the layer has not constructed. Step 4 is RH. The
crux fields stay `none`.
