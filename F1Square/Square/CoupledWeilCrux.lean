F1 square — **the coupled Weil kernel meets the crux faces** (`CoupledWeilCrux.lean`): wiring the
off-diagonal coupled kernel of `CoupledWeilKernel.lean` into the four built pairing/spectral faces
(`weilSpectralSquare`, `weil_psd_iff_hodge`, `spectral_bridge_nonneg`, `weil_strict_iff_crux`). The
capstone `coupledWeil_psd_iff_dominates` located the crux in one dominance inequality
`ArchDominatesPrime`; this file connects that inequality to the crux itself.

THE CHAIN (all genuine, kernel-checked, one-directional or as explicit equivalences — never asserting
the positivity):
  • `coupledWeil_diag_eq` — the coupled kernel's diagonal is the scalar Weil shape `arch n −
    primeGram(n,n)` (the pairing family `W n = coupledWeil(n,n)` feeding `weilSpectralSquare`).
  • `coupledWeil_psd_imp_hodgeNeg` — `WeilPSD (coupledWeil …)` forces Hodge-index negativity of the
    induced spectral square (through the diagonal, `WeilPSD_diag` + `weil_psd_iff_hodge`; Gate B free).
  • `coupledWeil_psd_imp_liNonneg` — hence Li non-negativity, through `spectral_bridge_nonneg`.
  • `archDominatesPrime_imp_liNonneg` — the **composed sufficiency**: the dominance inequality
    `ArchDominatesPrime` ⟹ `LiNonneg` of the induced square. So proving the archimedean form dominates
    the prime Gram yields (non-strict) Li-positivity — the sufficient half of the crux.
  • `coupledWeil_diag_strict_iff_crux` — **the exact face**: STRICT diagonal dominance of the coupled
    kernel (`arch n > primeGram(n,n) ∀n>0`) ⟺ `SpectralCrux` of the induced square (`weil_strict_iff_crux`).

HONEST SCOPE. Every statement is an implication (with the positivity/dominance as an explicit
hypothesis) or an equivalence to the still-open crux — NOTHING asserts `WeilPSD (coupledWeil …)`,
`ArchDominatesPrime`, or the strict dominance holds. `WeilPSD` gives only the non-strict `Rnonneg`
diagonal, so it reaches `LiNonneg` (as `embeds_to_liNonneg` does), NOT the strict crux; the strict
crux needs strict dominance, delivered here only as the ⟺ face, never discharged. This makes precise
that assembling the coupled kernel AND proving its dominance closes the crux — and that the dominance
IS RH (Weil 1952; Bombieri–Lagarias 1999). Crux fields stay `none`.

    `SpectralCrux` of the induced square (`weil_strict_iff_crux`). For the genuine data this strict
