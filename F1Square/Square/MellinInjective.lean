F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 87** (`MellinInjective.lean`): **THE MELLIN TRANSFORM IS
INJECTIVE ON THE COMPACT POLYNOMIAL CLASS** — the uniqueness/injectivity direction of the transform
pair, realized on polynomials by welding the co-support/transform condition to the now-complete `L²`
definiteness:

    `polyPN a b d` compactly supported, `f̂(n) = 0` for `n < d`  (`HatVanishes … d`, i.e. the
    Mellin transform vanishes below the degree)  ⟹  `polyPN a b d` is the **zero function** on
    `[0,1]`   (`polyPN_hatVanishes_zero_function`).

This is a one-line weld of two earlier results: co-support level `d` forces `L²`-nullity for a
`d`-coefficient polynomial (`polyPN_level_null`, brick 64 — through the orthogonality characterization
`hatVanishes_iff_orthogonal`), and `L²`-nullity forces pointwise vanishing on `[0,1]`
(`innerI_self_zero_imp_zero`, brick 79). Since for a compactly supported test the transform is the
moment sequence (`mellinHat_compact`), the co-support condition `HatVanishes … d` is exactly
"the Mellin transform vanishes below `d`". So a polynomial the transform cannot distinguish from the
zero test — one whose transform vanishes as far as its coefficient count reaches — is genuinely the
zero function, not merely moment-null. This is the injectivity half of the transform pair, for the
polynomial class.

HONEST SCOPE. Injectivity on the **polynomial** class, and against the zero function (equivalently:
two polynomial tests whose transforms agree far enough agree as functions on `[0,1]`, applied through
their difference). This is NOT the general transform pair (an inversion formula reconstructing an
arbitrary `f` from `f̂`), NOT the continuous parameter, and NOT injectivity beyond polynomials (that
would need Bernstein, which the layer does not have — a *non*-polynomial test with vanishing
transform is the open general-determinacy question). Nothing here touches the Weil form. Step 4 is
RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
