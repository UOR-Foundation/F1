F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 17** (`UniformCompletion.lean`): **THE
TRUNCATION-UNIFORM COMPLETION** — one constructed limit member converging at every truncation
simultaneously.

Brick 15 built the limit member at a FIXED truncation. The key structural fact making the
infinite-dimensional statement possible is COHERENCE: the limit coordinates do not depend on
the truncation they were built at —

- `limMember_coherent` — for `i < N` and `i < N'`, `limMember F N i ≈ limMember F N' i`: both
  are Bishop limits of sequences pointwise `≈ F j i` (the coefficient IS the coordinate at
  every truncation containing `i`), and `Rlim` respects pointwise `≈`.
- `limMemberU` — the DIAGONAL member: coordinate `i` is built at truncation `i+1`. By
  coherence it agrees with every fixed-truncation member on its range (`limMemberU_eq`).
- **`limMemberU_converges`** — for a truncation-UNIFORM squared-Cauchy sequence (`SqCauchyU`,
  the same canonical modulus at every `N`), the ONE member `limMemberU` satisfies
  `d²(F j, limMemberU) ≤ N·(2/(j+1))²` at EVERY truncation `N` — strong convergence of a
  single infinite object, uniformly constructed, choice-free.

WHY (the Sonine route, step 3). This removes the "fixed truncation" fence from brick 15: the
completed object is genuinely infinite-dimensional (one member, all truncations), assembled
from the coherent coordinate system — the direct-limit structure the layer has used since
`WeilPSD`'s `∀ N` now carries its completion. What remains on the completeness axis is only
the `L²` (function-space) strong completeness.

HONEST SCOPE. The rate `N·(2/(j+1))²` grows with the truncation — convergence is per-`N` with
a uniform CONSTRUCTION, not a truncation-uniform RATE (that would need summable coordinate
weights, i.e. genuine ℓ² data; fenced open). The crux fields stay `none`.
