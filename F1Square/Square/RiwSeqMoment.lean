/-
F1 square — **the real-window partial evaluates as a scaled moment** (`RiwSeqMoment.lean`): the
rational partial `∫_0^s (f · powBandGen_{[0,B]})` — the `riwSeq` term at the FIXED-band twist weight —
equals `s^(n+1) · mellinMoment (dilate_s f) n`, for any rational `s > 0` whose window `[0,s]` sits under
the fixed band (`s + 1 ≤ B`).

Three known-lemma steps, on top of the built `mellinMoment_dilate` (which is stated at the `s`-dependent
band `[0, s+1]`):
1. `riemannIntegralI_congr_Q` — bridge the window `[0, s]` written as `[⟨0,1⟩, s]` (the `riwSeq` shape)
   to `[mul s ⟨0,1⟩, mul s ⟨1,1⟩]` (the `mellinMoment_dilate` shape); the two are `Qeq`-equal windows.
2. `riemannIntegralI_congr_unit_mod` — swap the FIXED band `[0,B]` for `[0, s+1]` on that window: on
   `[0, s]` both weights are `xⁿ` (`powBandGen_eq_Rpow_on`, `p = s·x ≤ s ≤ min(B, s+1)`).
3. `mellinMoment_dilate`.

WHY. `riwI (f·powBandGen_{[0,B]}) = Rlim_k ∫_0^{qk k} (f·powBandGen)` with a FIXED band `B` (so the
integrand is constant across the `Rlim`); this lemma evaluates each term as
`(qk k)^(n+1)·mellinMoment(dilate_{qk k} f) n`. Passing the `Rlim` then gives the real-scale moment
covariance `mellinMoment(dilateTestR c f) n = c^{-(n+1)}·riwI …` — the factorization's inner integral at
a real scale.

HONEST SCOPE. The per-`s` evaluation of the real-window partial as a scaled moment. It builds NO `Rlim`
interchange (the covariance capstone), NO half-line assembly, NO factorization `M[f⋆g]=M[f]·M[g]`, NO
positivity, NO crux. Step 4 (band-coupling positivity) is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`.
