F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 36** (`CoSupportStrict.lean`): **THE CO-SUPPORT
FILTRATION DOES NOT COLLAPSE** — the nested subspaces

    `HatVanishes · 0  ⊇  HatVanishes · 1  ⊇  HatVanishes · 2  ⊇  HatVanishes · 3  ⊇  ⋯`

are STRICTLY decreasing at the levels the layer has realized, each strictness witnessed by a
constructed test that sits in one level and provably not the next.

Membership was the previous bricks' work; strictness needs the FIRST NON-VANISHING moment,
and brick 34's Gram closed form supplies it by arithmetic alone. For the `K = 3` member
`deep3 = x − 10x² + 30x³ − 35x⁴ + 14x⁵` the third moment is

    `(1/5 + 30/7 + 14/9) − (10/6 + 35/8) = 1903/315 − 145/24 = −1/2520 ≠ 0`

(`deep3_moment_three`), so `deep3 ∉ HatVanishes · 4` (`deep3_not_hatVanishes_four`) while
`deep3 ∈ HatVanishes · 3`: level 3 properly contains level 4. At the bottom, brick 25's
`bumpU = x(1−x)` has `f̂(0) = 1/6 ≠ 0`, so it sits in the (vacuous) level 0 and not in level 1.

WHY IT MATTERS (the Sonine route). A co-support condition that collapsed past some depth would
make the genuine `f, f̂` space finite-dimensional in the relevant direction, and the coupling
step 4 needs could not be an infinite-dimensional phenomenon. Strictness at the realized
depths is the finite shadow of the non-collapse the genuine Sonine space requires — evidence,
not proof, and stated as exactly that.

HONEST SCOPE. Strictness at the two witnessed levels (`0 ⊋ 1` and `3 ⊋ 4`), each by an
explicit constructed test; NOT a proof that every level is strict, and nothing about the Weil
form. Positivity beyond the complement is step 4 and is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
