F1 square — v0.19.0 (the genuine-pairing arc), brick W2: **THE WEIL PAIRING** — the
quadratic functional assembled with the zero side as the DEFECT (no zeros as inputs),
the pairing-induced spectral square (the first `SpectralSquare` whose `cSq` comes from a
pairing-valued assembly rather than through the dictionary), and the first COMPUTED
finite-place pairing value.

THE ASSEMBLY (CC unsymmetrized normalization, pinned in `Analysis/Weil.lean`):
    `W(f) = [f̃(1) + f̃(0)] − [Σ_n Λ(n)(f(n) + n⁻¹f(1/n)) + (log 4π + γ)f(1) + ∫₁^∞(…)]`
i.e. `W = poles − (primes + archimedean)` — classically `W(f) = Σ_ρ f̃(ρ)`, the zero
side, obtained WITHOUT constructing zeros: it is the defect of the built sides. Here
the finite-place sum and the archimedean constant are CONSTRUCTED (`weilPrimePart`,
`weilArchConst`); the two integral components (`poles`, `archTail`) are interface data
with their readings pinned verbatim (their closed-form reduction for piecewise-linear
test data is routine but UNVERIFIED IN PRINT — the deep-research open question — so
transcribing it would breach the gate; they are never fabricated).

THE CRITERION [CLASSICAL, verified verbatim]: `RH ⟺ W(g ⋆ g^τ) ≥ 0` for all test `g` —
ELEMENTARY in both directions (Weil 1952; Burnol arXiv math/9810169 proves the Lemma
directly without a density argument; compactly-supported piecewise-linear `g` is
admissible per Bombieri's class `W`, the official Clay problem description §V; the zero
sum is the symmetric limit). Through `weilSpectralSquare` this face joins the three
existing faces: PSD of the genuine pairing family ⟺ Hodge-index negativity ⟺ Li
non-negativity ⟺ dominance — ONE proposition, now with the pairing face carried by an
ASSEMBLED object.

THE UNCONDITIONAL TERRITORY (recorded; the pinned next mechanization target): for test
support in `[2^{−1/2}, 2^{1/2}]` (so `f = g ⋆ g^τ` is supported in `(1/2, 2)` and NO
prime power contributes — the finite-place side vanishes BY CONSTRUCTION here, exactly
`weilPrimePart_stable`'s regime), Weil positivity holds UNCONDITIONALLY:
Connes–Consani, Selecta Math. 27 (2021) art. 77, Thm 1 — the form is the trace of a
positive operator (the Sonine-space projection; an infinite-dimensional certificate);
Burnol's precursor (math/0101068) certifies a smaller window `[1/c, c]`, `c < √2`, by an
EXPLICIT nonnegative spectral multiplier `α(τ) = 8√2·cos(τ·log 2)/(1+4τ²) + h₊(τ)`,
`h₊(τ) = −log π + Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2)` — the natural constructive SOS target (it needs
uniform-in-τ digamma bounds, beyond any finite check; recorded, not asserted). The
boundary at the first prime (`x = 2`, `1/2`) is exactly where RH begins.

FAITHFULNESS: nothing here asserts PSD for the genuine family; the loose existential
over `W`-families is satisfiable and NOT RH (`weil_template_crux` mirror below); the
crux fields stay `none`.

    terms `f̃(1) + f̃(0)` and the archimedean integral (CC arXiv eq. 150, the
    `f(1)`-subtracted principal value, with its non-truncatable tail) — the two

/-- **The pairing-induced spectral square**: from any family of pairing values
    `W : Nat → Real` (the genuine instance: `W n = W(gₙ ⋆ gₙ^τ)` over an enumeration of
    test functions), the spectral enrichment with `λₙ = ½W(n)`, `⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ = −W(n)` — the

    square — the pairing face joins the geometric face. -/

/-- **Strict positivity of the pairing family ⟺ the crux** of the induced spectral
    square (hence ⟺ `LiCrux` ⟺ dominance, through the standing equivalences) — the

/-- **The two-sidedness guard**: the pairing-face property is satisfiable (the
    constant-`1` family induces a crux-satisfying spectral square), so the loose
    existential `∃ W, SpectralCrux (weilSpectralSquare W)` is true and NOT RH — the
    crux is the GENUINE pairing family, never an existential (the standing caution,
    pairing face). -/

    at the tent peaked at `2` is exactly `log 2` — the pairing SEES the prime `2`
