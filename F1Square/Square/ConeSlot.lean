/-
F1 square — **the realized cone slot** (`ConeSlot.lean`): the `t4` log-tent (the FIRST cone-shaped
datum with a live prime side) gets its `WeilSlot` — every interface field a genuine constructed
integral — and its Weil-functional closed form:

    `W(t4) ≈ (9/4 + t4H²) − (primes + (log4π+γ)·t4H + (t4H·log(3/2) − t4Dilog))`

with `t4H = 2·log 2`, primes from `t4PrimePart_eq`, and the dilog carried as the constructed
`t4Dilog` (no closed form exists). The archimedean tail assembles from the three shipped bricks:
the compact reciprocal half (`t4Trecip_sum`), the constructed dilog (`DilogPieces`), and the
improper remainder (`t4Improper_eq`).

The sign `W(t4) > 0` (`t4WeilValue_pos`, margin `≈ +0.05`) is certified by `M = 512` harmonic
wedges for `log 2`/`log(3/2)`/`log 3`, the standing `log 4π`/`γ` brackets, the rational dilog
lower bound `t4Dilog ≥ 1.909`, and one closing exact rational `decide`. This is the first
certified `W > 0` ON THE AUTOCORRELATION CONE with a live prime side — the sign RH demands there.

HONEST SCOPE. One realized slot and its sign; positivity for ONE cone element, not the cone
(uniform positivity on the cone = RH). The crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`.

/-- **`W(t4) > 0` — THE FIRST CERTIFIED POSITIVITY ON THE AUTOCORRELATION CONE with a live
    prime side** (margin `≈ +0.0558`): the sign RH demands on the cone, realized at one cone
    element. Certified through the kernel-evaluated slot fields, the `M = 512` harmonic wedges,
    the standing `log 4π`/`γ` brackets, and the rational dilog lower bound; the closing `decide`
    is exact bignum arithmetic. NOT claimed: positivity for the cone (that uniform statement is
    RH); the crux fields stay `none`. -/
