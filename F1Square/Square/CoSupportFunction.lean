F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 83** (`CoSupportFunction.lean`): **THE CO-SUPPORT
MEMBERS ARE GENUINELY NONZERO FUNCTIONS ON `[0,1]`** — the function-level upgrade the definiteness
iff (brick 81) unlocks for the co-support filtration.

Until now the strictness of the co-support filtration lived at the *moment* level: `deep3` and the
`combo345` family were certified nonzero by an exact nonzero moment (third moment `−1/2520`,
`−a/2520`), turned into `Pos` moment-energy by brick 45. That is a statement about the moment
sequence, not about the test as a function. The definiteness iff closes the gap:

    `¬ Req (innerI φ φ) zero`   ⟹   `¬ (∀ x ∈ [0,1], φ(x) ≈ 0)`
      (`not_vanishing_of_innerI_self_not_zero`, the `.mpr` of `innerI_self_zero_iff_unit_zero`).

So a test with nonzero `L²` self-energy cannot vanish identically on `[0,1]`. Chaining the moment
side (`momentL2Sq_zero_of_innerI_self_zero` contrapositive against the certified `Pos` energy) gives
that `deep3` (`deep3_not_vanishing_on_unit`) and the whole `combo345 a b c` family with `a ≥ 1`
(`combo345_not_vanishing_on_unit`) are honestly nonzero **functions** on `[0,1]` — the filtration's
distinct levels are witnessed by tests that genuinely differ as functions there, not merely in their
moments.

HONEST SCOPE. `¬ (∀ x ∈ [0,1], φ(x) ≈ 0)` — "does not vanish identically on `[0,1]`". This is the
constructive negation of universal vanishing, NOT a constructed point of non-vanishing (exhibiting
such a point is a stronger, location-flavoured statement not made here). It is exactly the
function-level counterpart of the moment/energy non-vanishing already certified. Nothing here
touches the Weil form; the co-support skeleton's positivity is still diagonal-multiplier level only.
Step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
