F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 29** (`BandBridge.lean`): **THE BAND BRIDGE** —
the moment map carries the transform-side co-support condition into the discrete skeleton's
band condition, and the skeleton's UNCONDITIONAL complement-positivity fires on genuine
transform data.

The carrier is the moment map `momSeq φ = (mellinMoment φ n)ₙ` — a discrete-side coefficient
family built from a constructed test. Along it the two bands are RELATED:

- `momSeq_fourier` — the indicator-Fourier coefficient of the moment sequence IS the monomial
  pairing: `⟨momSeq φ, δₖ⟩_N ≈ ⟨φ, xᵏ⟩`. The indicator directions on the skeleton side
  correspond to the monomial directions on the test side, coefficient by coefficient.
- `momSeq_band_vanishes` — for a `[0,1]`-supported test, `HatVanishes φ K` pushes forward to
  the skeleton's condition: the first `K` coordinates of `momSeq φ` vanish (brick 28's weld).
- `momSeq_bandProj_fixed` — a `K = 2` co-support test's moment sequence is FIXED by the
  skeleton's band projection: it already lives in the Sonine complement (the negative-band
  index `1` is inside `{0, 1}`).
- **`weil_psd_on_cosupport`** — the capstone: for a `[0,1]`-supported test with
  `HatVanishes φ 2`, the discrete Weil multiplier form is nonnegative ON ITS MOMENT SEQUENCE
  at every truncation — `burnol_pairing_psd_on_sonine` with the band hypothesis discharged by
  the constructed transform's vanishing. The skeleton's unconditional positivity, realized for
  the first time on `f, f̂` data rather than an abstract coefficient family.

HONEST SCOPE. The bridge runs through the moment map at the discrete Burnol skeleton's
single-index band; the positivity delivered is the skeleton's DIAGONAL multiplier form on
moment data — not the Weil functional on the test space, and not positivity beyond the
complement (that is step 4 and is RH). The `K = 2` instance is currently inhabited by the
zero test only (`hatVanishes_zeroL2`); a NONZERO `K = 2` member needs the quartic engine
(banked). The crux fields stay `none`.
