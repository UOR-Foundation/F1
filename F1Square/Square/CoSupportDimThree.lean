F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 67** (`CoSupportDimThree.lean`): **THE LEVEL IS AT
LEAST THREE-DIMENSIONAL** — brick 55 read the first two coefficients off the triangular moment
table and left the third open. This closes it:

    `a·deep3 + b·deep4 + c·deep5` has vanishing `x³`, `x⁴` and `x⁵` moments  ⟹  `a = b = c = 0`
      (`deep345_independent`).

The missing entry was the `x⁵` row, where all three members contribute
(`⟨deep3,x⁵⟩ = −1/924`, `⟨deep4,x⁵⟩ = 1/5544`, `⟨deep5,x⁵⟩ = −1/72072`) and the assembled
rational identity carries the product denominator `924·5544·72072 ≈ 3.7·10¹¹`. Brick 55 recorded
that as out of the elaborator's budget. **That record was wrong**: the assembled identity is
*linear* in the coefficients, so `ring_uor` normalises it in a single pass, and the step below
elaborates at the DEFAULT heartbeat budget with no `set_option` at all. Nothing conceptual and
nothing mechanical was in the way; brick 55's note is retracted here.

So the co-support level `3` contains three `ℕ`-independent constructed members, not two, and the
`ℕ`-parametrized family of brick 58 is genuinely three-parameter.

HONEST SCOPE. Independence over `ℕ` coefficients of the three constructed members, read off the
exact moment table — still not a dimension formula, and still says nothing about levels beyond
the realized ones. Nothing here touches the Weil form. Step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
