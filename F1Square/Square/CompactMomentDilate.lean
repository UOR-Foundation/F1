F1 square — **the compact `[0,1]`-window Mellin dilation covariance** (`CompactMomentDilate.lean`):
the `[0,1]`-window companion of the committed per-window tail dilation
(`window_dilate_powBandGen` + `twTerm_eq_window_powBandGen`), specialised to the moment window
`[0,1]` with the genuine clamped Mellin weight `powTest`.

For a test `φ`, a degree-`n` twist, and a rational scale `s > 0`, the scaled compact integral over
`[0, s]` of `φ` against the wide-band twist `powBandGen 0 (s+1) … n` equals `s^(n+1)` times the
compact moment `mellinMoment` of the `s`-dilated test:

    `∫_0^s (φ · powBandGen_{[0,s+1]}) = s^(n+1) · mellinMoment (dilate_s φ) n`.

The band `[0, s+1]` covers both the moment window `[0,1]` and the scaled window `[0, s]`, so the
un-clamped twist is homogeneous there. Three moves, mirroring the tail bricks with `[m+1,m+2]`
replaced by `[0,1]` and `powWinTest` by `powTest`: STEP A applies the committed per-window dilation
`mellinWindowDilate` at `lo = 0`, `w = 1` (its `hHom` discharged by `powBandGen_dilate_on`); STEP B
swaps the wide-band weight for `powTest n` on the unit window via the different-`L` congruence
`riemannIntegralI_congr_unit_mod` (both weights are `tⁿ` there); STEP C identifies the unit-window
interval integral with `mellinMoment` through `riemannIntegralI_unit`.

HONEST SCOPE. The compact dilation covariance — the scaled compact integral over `[0,s]` of `φ`
against `powBandGen` equals `s^(n+1)` times the compact moment `mellinMoment` of the dilated test,
the `[0,1]`-window companion of the committed per-window tail dilation (`mellinWindowDilate` at
`lo = 0`, `w = 1` + weight-swap to `powTest` + the unit bridge). It builds NO half-line assembly, NO
boundary reconciliation, NO split-point independence, NO full `mellinHat` covariance, NO
factorization, NO positivity, NO determinacy, NO crux. Step 4 (band-coupling positivity) is RH; the
crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
