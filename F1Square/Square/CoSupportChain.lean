F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 37** (`CoSupportChain.lean`): **THE STRICT CHAIN
THROUGH DEPTH 4** — the co-support filtration is strictly decreasing at every level the layer
has reached:

    `HatVanishes · 0  ⊋  HatVanishes · 1  ⊋  HatVanishes · 2  ⊋  HatVanishes · 3  ⊋  HatVanishes · 4`

Brick 36 witnessed the two ends (`bumpU` at level 0, `deep3` at level 3). This brick fills the
middle with the two members the Hilbert system supplies at depths 1 and 2, both in the
`P − N` linear form that brick 35's helpers evaluate mechanically:

- `lin1 = x − 3x² + 2x³` — moment `0` vanishes (`1 − 1`), moment `1` is `11/15 − 3/4 = −1/60`;
- `lin2 = x − 6x² + 10x³ − 5x⁴` — moments `0, 1` vanish (`3 − 3`, `7/3 − 7/3`), moment `2` is
  `23/12 − 67/35 = 1/420`.

Each is unit-supported (coefficients sum to zero) and apart from zero (`lin1(1/10) = 9/125`,
`lin2(1/10) = 99/2000`), so each sits in its level and provably not the next. Every moment is
read straight off `⟨xⁱ, xʲ⟩ = 1/(i+j+1)`; no new integration.

HONEST SCOPE. Strictness at the four realized levels, each by an explicit constructed test;
NOT a proof that every level is strict — that would need the Hilbert sections' invertibility
in general — and nothing about the Weil form. Positivity beyond the complement is step 4 and
is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.
