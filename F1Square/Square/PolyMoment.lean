F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 65** (`PolyMoment.lean`): **EVERY POLYNOMIAL TEST'S
MOMENT, IN CLOSED FORM** — one theorem replacing every per-member moment computation the layer has
done by hand:

    `⟨Σ_{i<d} a_i xⁱ, xⁿ⟩  =  Σ_{i<d} a_i/(i+n+1)`   (`mellinMoment_polyN`)
    `⟨polyPN a b d, xⁿ⟩     =  polyMomQ a n d − polyMomQ b n d`   (`mellinMoment_polyPN`),

an explicit **rational**, read straight off brick 34's Hilbert matrix `⟨xⁱ,xⁿ⟩ = 1/(i+n+1)`. Every
constructed member so far — `cubeBump`, the quartic, `deep3 … deep6`, `lin1`, `lin2` — had its
moments evaluated by a hand-built `pv_add`/`pv_scale` chain, one theorem per degree per member.
This is the general law those chains were instances of, proved once by induction on the
coefficient count.

The consequence is that the polynomial co-support theory is **finite rational linear algebra**:
`polyPN a b d` lies in co-support level `K` exactly when the `K` rational equations
`polyMomQ a n d = polyMomQ b n d` (`n < K`) hold (`polyPN_moments_zero_of_rational`), and with
brick 64 the case `K = d` already forces the *whole* moment sequence to vanish
(`polyPN_all_moments_zero_of_rational`). Constructing a member at any depth is now a `ℚ`-linear
solve against the Hilbert matrix, with no new integration and no new per-degree engine.

The formula is cross-checked against an independently hand-computed value: the same coefficient
data as brick 36's `lin1 = x − 3x² + 2x³`, run through `polyMomQ`, reproduces
`⟨lin1, x⁰⟩ = 0` and `⟨lin1, x¹⟩ = −1/60` (`polyMoment_lin1_zero`, `polyMoment_lin1_one`).

HONEST SCOPE. A closed form for the moments of `ℤ`-coefficient polynomial tests on `[0,1]`.
It says nothing about which coefficient vectors solve the system (existence at general `K` is
still the hypergeometric identity the layer cannot reach), nothing about the support side
(`polyPN a b d` is `[0,1]`-supported exactly when the two coefficient sums agree — not needed
here, since the statement is at the moment level), and nothing about the Weil form. Step 4 is RH.
The crux fields stay `none`.
