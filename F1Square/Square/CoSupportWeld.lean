F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 28** (`CoSupportWeld.lean`): **THE WELD** — the
transform-side co-support condition IS an orthogonality condition: for compact tests,

    `HatVanishes φ K  ⟺  φ ⊥ xⁿ for all n < K`   (`hatVanishes_iff_orthogonal`).

This is the `f, f̂` pair statement in its first genuine form. The pair is bundled
(`MellinPair`: a test with its all-order decay data, `MellinPair.hat` its transform), and the
co-support condition on the transform side is proven EQUIVALENT to vanishing of the L²
pairings against the monomial band directions `powTest n` — the function-space mirror of the
skeleton's `c(i) = 0` on the band (which was vanishing against the indicator directions,
`bandProj`). Orthogonality extends over the band's span (`orthogonal_band_add`, by the
pairing's bilinearity), so the condition is against the SUBSPACE the directions span, not
just the directions.

Realized instance: `cubePair` (the brick-27 cubic bump as a pair), with
`cubePair_orthogonal` — a genuine nonzero test orthogonal to the `K = 1` band whose
transform accordingly vanishes there.

HONEST SCOPE. The weld is for `[0,1]`-supported tests, and the band is the MONOMIAL band
`{xⁿ : n < K}` — not yet the skeleton's indicator band (the two bands' relation is the
remaining welding step toward `bandProj`), no continuous parameter, no inversion. Positivity
of the Weil form on the orthogonal complement is step 4 and is RH. The crux fields stay
`none`.
