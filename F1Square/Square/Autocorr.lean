F1 square — **the autocorrelation `g ⋆ g^τ`** (`Autocorr.lean`): the cone object the Weil prime side
lives on, constructed from the multiplicative convolution.

The doc's step 2/4 pin the target: "Weil positivity is not a pointwise feature of the admissible
class, it lives on the cone `g ⋆ g^τ`." That cone is now a built object:

    `autocorr g x = (g ⋆ g^τ)(x) = ∫ g(x/t)·g(1/t) dt/t`     (`g^τ(t) = g(1/t) = reflectTest a g`),

i.e. `mulConv g (reflectTest a g) x` — the convolution of `g` with its multiplicative reflection.
`autocorr_nonneg`: for a non-negative `g` the autocorrelation is non-negative (the *integrand* is a
product of non-negatives on the window). This is the non-negativity of the DENSITY, at the level of
the constructed integral.

HONEST SCOPE — the load-bearing bright line. This constructs the autocorrelation cone and the
sign of its Haar-integral integrand. It is emphatically NOT the positivity of the **Weil functional**
on the cone — that uniform statement (over the band-indexed cone family, against the live prime side)
is exactly step 4 = RH, and nothing here asserts it. It is also NOT the Mellin convolution theorem
that would identify these values with `weilPrimeGram (vFrom g)`. The crux fields stay `none`.
