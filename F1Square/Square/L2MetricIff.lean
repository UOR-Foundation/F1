F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 82** (`L2MetricIff.lean`): **THE `L²` DISTANCE IS A
GENUINE METRIC ON `[0,1]`** — the two-directional separation, closing brick 80 to an iff:

    `dist2I φ ψ ≈ 0`   ⟺   `∀ x ∈ [0,1], φ(x) ≈ ψ(x)`   (`dist2I_zero_iff_pointwise_eq`).

Brick 80 gave the forward direction (zero `L²` distance forces pointwise agreement on `[0,1]`); this
adds the converse via brick 81's reverse definiteness, applied to the difference test
`L2Test.sub φ ψ` (whose value at `x` is `φ(x) − ψ(x)`, definitionally): two tests that agree at
every point of `[0,1]` have `L²` distance zero. So the `L²` distance-squared `dist2I` vanishes
**exactly** on the pointwise-`[0,1]`-equality relation — it is a genuine metric there (`dist2I = 0`
iff the two functions coincide on `[0,1]`), the zero set is neither coarser nor finer than pointwise
agreement.

HONEST SCOPE. Both directions, on `[0,1]` only. This is the separation iff — the `L²` class is in
bijection with functions on `[0,1]` modulo nothing (on that domain) — NOT a full isometry to any
function space, and NOT the moment problem. Nothing here touches the Weil form. Step 4 is RH. The
crux fields stay `none`.
