F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 32** (`DeepMember.lean`): **THE NONZERO `K = 2`
CO-SUPPORT MEMBER** — a genuine nonzero `[0,1]`-supported test whose transform vanishes at
BOTH integer points `0, 1`, so the skeleton's unconditional positivity
(`weil_psd_on_cosupport`, brick 29) fires on genuinely NONZERO `f, f̂` data.

The member is `x(1−x)(1−5x+5x²)`, realized in EXPANDED form as the linear combination
`c − 6c² + 10c³ − 5c⁴` of clamped-power tests (`deepBump`), so that:

- the moments split by the pairing's BILINEARITY (`innerI_add_left`/`innerI_neg_left`) into
  the certified engine values `(1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6)` of bricks 23–31, which cancel:
  `∫p = 1/2 − 2 + 5/2 − 1 = 0` and `∫xp = 1/3 − 3/2 + 2 − 5/6 = 0`
  (`deepBump_moment_zero`/`_one`) — no product expansion, no shared-modulus juggling;
- unit support follows from `p(1) = 0`: at every window point the clamp saturates and the
  coefficient tree collapses to `(1 + 10) − (6 + 5) = 0` (`deepBump_supp`);
- apartness is witnessed at `x = 1/10`: `p(1/10) = 99/2000 > 0`
  (`deepBump_value_tenth`/`deepBump_apart`).

`deepBump_hatVanishes` places it in `HatVanishes · 2` through the brick-22 moment bridge, and
**`weil_psd_nonzero_instance`** is the capstone: the discrete Weil multiplier form is
nonnegative on `momSeq deepBump` at every truncation — the band hypothesis discharged by a
CONSTRUCTED transform's vanishing at a certified NONZERO test. No RH.

HONEST SCOPE. One nonzero member at `K = 2`; deeper `K` needs higher-degree engines; the
positivity delivered remains the skeleton's diagonal multiplier form on moment data — not
the Weil functional on the test space, and not positivity beyond the complement (step 4,
= RH). The crux fields stay `none`.
