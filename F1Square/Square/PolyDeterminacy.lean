F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 64** (`PolyDeterminacy.lean`): **DETERMINACY ON THE
POLYNOMIAL CLASS, AND A DEGREE FLOOR FOR CO-SUPPORT MEMBERS** — the first determinacy result the
layer has, and the structural reason the constructed members `deep3 … deep6` have to grow in
degree with their level.

For an integer-coefficient polynomial test with `d` coefficients (`polyPN a b d`, the repo's own
positive/negative-part idiom, `Σ_{i<d} a_i x^i − Σ_{i<d} b_i x^i`):

    first `d` moments vanish  ⟹  `⟨p,p⟩ ≈ 0`  ⟹  **every** moment vanishes
      (`innerI_polyPN_self_zero`, `polyPN_all_moments_zero`).

Read forwards, that is determinacy on the polynomial class: `d` conditions already exhaust the
moment sequence, so the co-support filtration cannot cut a polynomial test any finer than its own
coefficient count. Read backwards, it is a **degree floor**: a polynomial test that is not
L²-null cannot sit in level `d` unless it carries more than `d` coefficients. The built members
obey it exactly — `deep3` is in level `3` and runs to `x⁴`, `deep6` is in level `6` and runs to
`x⁸` — and it says that growth is forced, not an artifact of how the members were solved.

The proof needs no approximation theory. Expanding `p` in the FIRST slot against `p` in the
second, bilinearity turns `⟨p,p⟩` into a `ℕ`-scaled sum of `⟨xⁱ, p⟩ = ⟨p, xⁱ⟩` over `i < d`
(`innerI_symm`), each of which is a hypothesis. The scaling transfer is brick 43's `pv_scale` at
the rational value `0`, so the sealed (`@[irreducible]`) `natScale` never has to be unfolded. The
step from `⟨p,p⟩ ≈ 0` to *every* moment is brick 63.

HONEST SCOPE — READ THIS BEFORE PARAPHRASING THE RESULT. What is proven is determinacy at the
**moment / energy** level: `d` vanishing moments force `⟨p,p⟩ ≈ 0` and force *every* moment to
vanish. It is **NOT** proven that `p` is the zero function. Going from `∫₀¹ p² ≈ 0` to `p(x) ≈ 0`
pointwise needs interval splitting of the certified integral (`∫₀¹ = ∫₀^a + ∫_a^1`), which the
integral API does **not** have — it carries only nonneg/le/add/congr/neg/smul on a fixed interval.
So "a polynomial with all moments zero is zero" is a **stronger statement than this file proves**;
the correct summary is "a polynomial test with `d` coefficients and `d` vanishing moments is
moment-null and L²-energy-null". Determinacy for **polynomial** tests, in that sense, only. The
general question — a nonzero bounded-Lipschitz test on `[0,1]` with every moment vanishing — is
untouched; it needs a constructive approximation theorem (Bernstein) the repo does not have. The support side is also
untouched: `polyPN a b d` is `[0,1]`-supported exactly when `Σ a_i = Σ b_i` (the "both parts sum
to the same value" condition the built members satisfy), which is not needed here because the
statement is at the moment level. Nothing touches the Weil form. Step 4 is RH. The crux fields
stay `none`.
