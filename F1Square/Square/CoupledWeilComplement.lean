F1 square — **the complement projection does not rescue the coupled kernel** (`CoupledWeilComplement.lean`):
the kernel-checked answer, for the off-diagonal coupled kernel, to the program doc's central question —
does the unconditional complement-positivity of the DIAGONAL multiplier form extend? It does NOT.

`multForm_psd_on_complement` (SonineProjection.lean) is UNCONDITIONAL: a test `c` vanishing on the
archimedean negative band gives `weilQuad (multForm arch) c N ≥ 0`, no RH — the Sonine-support skeleton.
But the coupled kernel SUBTRACTS the prime Gram, and the prime Gram is itself PSD (for `w ≥ 0`), so on
the complement the coupled form is

    `weilQuad (coupledWeil arch w v M) c N = (arch complement energy ≥ 0) − (prime energy ≥ 0)`

— a difference of two nonnegative quantities, sign UNDETERMINED. The complement projection kills the
archimedean negative band but leaves the subtracted prime energy untouched; positivity there still
requires the prime energy to be dominated by the (now nonnegative) arch energy. This is the doc's
SECOND dichotomy branch, kernel-checked: the skeleton's unconditional positivity does not carry to the
whole (coupled) form — that carrying is step 4 = RH.

THE LAWS (all genuine, kernel-checked):
  • `coupledWeil_complement_signed` — on the complement (and `w ≥ 0`) the coupled form is `A − P` with
    `A = weilQuad (multForm arch) c N ≥ 0` and `P = weilQuad (primeGram w v M) c N ≥ 0` (both nonneg;
    the split holds; sign of the difference undetermined).
  • `coupledWeil_complement_lower` — hence the coupled form on the complement is bounded below by
    `−P` (NOT by `0`): `Rle (Rneg P) (weilQuad (coupledWeil …) c N)` — the genuine negative gap the
    subtracted prime leaves.
  • `coupledWeil_complement_psd_iff` — on the complement, coupled positivity ⟺ the prime energy is
    dominated by the (nonnegative) arch energy: `Rnonneg (weilQuad (coupledWeil …) c N) ⟺ P ≤ A`.

HONEST SCOPE. Pure sign/algebra on the assembled object; abstract over interface data `arch, w, v`
(`w ≥ 0`; the von Mangoldt case is unconditional). NOTHING asserts the coupled form is positive OR
indefinite at any genuine data — these laws only exhibit the two nonnegative pieces and locate the
residual (prime dominance) that the complement projection does not discharge. Crux fields stay `none`.
