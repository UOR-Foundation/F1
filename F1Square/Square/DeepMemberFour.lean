F1 square — **the pre-Hilbert layer, brick 41** (`DeepMemberFour.lean`): **THE `K = 4`
CO-SUPPORT MEMBER**, and with it the strict chain extended one level further —
`HatVanishes · 4 ⊋ HatVanishes · 5`.

With brick 34's Gram closed form `⟨xⁱ, xʲ⟩ = 1/(i+j+1)` and brick 35's `natScale` helper, a
member at depth `K` is a finite rational linear-algebra problem: solve

    Σᵢ aᵢ/(i+n+1) = 0  (n = 0,1,2,3),   Σᵢ aᵢ = 0   (the support condition)

over `i = 1..6`. The solution is `a = (1, −15, 70, −140, 126, −42)`:

    `deep4 = x − 15x² + 70x³ − 140x⁴ + 126x⁵ − 42x⁶`.

Its first non-vanishing moment is read off the same Gram matrix, no new integration:

    `⟨deep4, x⁴⟩ = (1/6 + 70/8 + 126/10) − (15/7 + 140/9 + 42/11) = 1291/60 − 14911/693
                 = 1/13860 ≠ 0`,

so `deep4 ∈ HatVanishes · 4` and `deep4 ∉ HatVanishes · 5` (`cosupport_strict_at_four`),
extending brick 37's chain `0 ⊋ 1 ⊋ 2 ⊋ 3 ⊋ 4` to `0 ⊋ 1 ⊋ 2 ⊋ 3 ⊋ 4 ⊋ 5`. The member is
apart from zero (`deep4(1/10) = 3609/500000`), so the capstone `weil_psd_deep4` fires the
skeleton's unconditional positivity on genuinely nonzero `f, f̂` data whose transform vanishes
at FOUR integer points.

HONEST SCOPE. One more member, one more strict level — a deeper finite shadow of the
non-collapse the genuine Sonine space requires, NOT a proof that every level is inhabited or
strict (that needs invertibility of the Hilbert sections in general). The positivity delivered
is still the skeleton's diagonal multiplier form on moment data, not the Weil functional on the
test space, and not positivity beyond the complement — step 4, which is RH. The crux fields
stay `none`.
