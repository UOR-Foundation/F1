F1 square — **tendsto ⟹ per-index real closeness, and its Lipschitz image** (`RTendsToClose.lean`):
two general Bishop-real primitives that convert the seq-level convergence predicate `RTendsTo` into a
per-`k` REAL closeness bound, and push that bound through a Lipschitz map.

`RTendsTo X L` is defined at the sequence level (`∀ k n, |X_k.seq n − L.seq n| ≤ 2/(k+1) + 2/(n+1)`).
`RTendsTo_imp_close` reads off the clean REAL statement it implies — that the `k`-th term is within
`2/(k+1)` of the limit as a real number: `|X_k − L| ≤ 2/(k+1)` (using the tendsto bound at the doubled
index `2n+1`, then `2/(2n+2) ≤ 2/(n+1)`). `Rlip_close` composes this with a real Lipschitz bound: the
Lipschitz image of a convergent sequence is close to the image of the limit, `|g(X_k) − g(L)| ≤
K·(2/(k+1))`.

WHY (rung 6, the non-acceleration half of the Lipschitz squeeze). The real-scale covariance capstone
needs `mellinHat (dilate_{q_k} φ) → mellinHat (dilate_c φ)` as the rationals `q_k → c`, which is
"a Lipschitz function preserves limits". That splits into (i) the Lipschitz image is CLOSE to the
image-of-limit at the scaled rate `K·2/(k+1)` — built here, no index acceleration — and (ii)
converting that per-`k` closeness back into `RTendsTo` at the canonical rate, which needs a
`K`-index reindex (`RmulK`/`Ridx`-style) and is NOT built here.

HONEST SCOPE. Two general Bishop-real convergence primitives only. It builds NO `RTendsTo` of a
Lipschitz image (the reindex half is unbuilt), NO scale continuity, NO covariance, NO factorization,
NO positivity, NO determinacy, NO crux. Step 4 (band-coupling positivity) is RH; the crux fields stay
`none`.

/-- **Tendsto implies per-index real closeness**: `RTendsTo X L` gives `|X_k − L| ≤ 2/(k+1)` as a real
    number, for every `k`. The seq-level bound at the doubled index `2n+1` (`h k (2n+1)`) supplies
    `|X_k.seq(2n+1) − L.seq(2n+1)| ≤ 2/(k+1) + 2/(2n+2)`, and `2/(2n+2) ≤ 2/(n+1)` closes the `Rle`. -/
