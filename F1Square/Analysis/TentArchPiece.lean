F1 square — **the tent test's archimedean-tail `[1,2]` piece, CONSTRUCTED and EVALUATED**
(`TentArchPiece.lean`):

    `∫_{1}^{2} −(1 + 2/x − 4/(x+1)) dx  ≈  −(1 + 2·log 2 − 4·(log 3 − log 2))`
                                        `=  −1 − 6·log 2 + 4·log 3`     (`tent_arch12`)

— the compact part of the tent's archimedean tail (the PV-cancelled integrand on the support;
the improper part past the support, `∫_2^∞ −2/(x²−1) = −log 3`, is the remaining brick; the
full tail is `−1 − 6·log 2 + 3·log 3`).

HOW. The integrand is totalized with the floor-1 clamp only (`x ≥ 1`, `x+1 ≥ 2` on the
domain); the affine pullback `x = 1+t` is POINTWISE congruent to
`−(1 + 2·gRecip t − 4·gRecip32 t)`, and gateway linearity reduces the value to the two
certified reciprocal integrals `∫₀¹ dx/(1+x) ≈ log 2` (`HarmonicLog.lean`) and
`∫₀¹ dx/(2+x) ≈ log 3 − log 2` (`HarmonicLog32.lean`).

HONEST SCOPE. Substrate for the crux route's steps 1–2; no positivity, no crux claim. The
crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`.
