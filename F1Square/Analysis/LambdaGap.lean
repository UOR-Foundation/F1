F1 square — the certificate front (workstream 1, the prune substrate): **the λ₂ − λ₁ GAP**,
`2λ₂ − 2λ₁ ≥ 0.113 > 0`, hence `λ₁ ≉ λ₂`.

WHY THIS BRICK. The Gate-A finite-list template (`Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`) reduces the
uniform diagonal identity `gramOf ι D n n ≈ 2λₙ` to a finite hypothesis list around a generating
recurrence. The FIRST candidate class — the order-1 constant recurrence `s(n+1) = s(n)`, i.e.
every embedding whose squared-norm diagonal is eventually periodic of period one — forces
`2λ₂ ≈ 2λ₁` on the λ side of the list. This brick refutes that hypothesis once and for all:
the certified brackets already in stock separate λ₂ from λ₁, so the WHOLE class is pruned for
every rule `ι` and every dimension `D` at once (recorded in `Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`).

THE CANCELLATION TRICK (why no new numerics are needed). Directly upper-bounding λ₁ needs a
LOWER bracket on `log 4π`, which the substrate does not have (only `Rlog4pic_le`). But in the
difference the `log 4π` atoms cancel ALGEBRAICALLY:

    2λ₂ − 2λ₁ = γ − 2γ² − 4γ₁ − log 4π + (3/2)ζ(2),

and every surviving constant enters with the sign whose certified bracket EXISTS:
`γ ≥ 0.577` (`Rgamma_h_ge_577`), `γ² ≤ 0.578²` (`Rgamma_sq_le`), `γ₁ ≤ −0.0677`
(`Rgamma1_le_neg0677`), `log 4π ≤ 2.5316` (`Rlog4pic_le`), `ζ(2) ≥ 1.644` (`zeta2_lower_tight`).
The rearrangement is done in the `RsumL` additive normalizer (`RAddNF`): flatten
`(λ₂ + λ₂) − 2λ₁` to a signed-atom list, cancel the single `(−log4π, −−log4π)` pair with
`RsumL_cancel_anywhere` (no permutation is even needed — the flattening order already
interleaves them correctly), and lower-bound the 13-atom residual by a rounded rational
accumulator at denominator 10⁴:

    residual ≥ 1130/10000 = 0.113   (true value 2(λ₂−λ₁) ≈ 0.1385).

WHAT IS PROVED.
- `lambda_gap_lower` : `2λ₂ − 2λ₁ ≥ 1130/10000` (with `2λ₁ = Rtwolambda1`, the integer-coefficient
  form — no halving anywhere).
- `lambda_gap_pos`   : `Pos (2λ₂ − 2λ₁)`.
- `Rlambda1_ne_Rlambda2` : `¬ (λ₁ ≈ λ₂)` — the first certified SEPARATION of two Li
  coefficients in the substrate (positivity of each was already known; distinctness was not).

HONEST SCOPE. This is a finite, `n ≤ 2` fact about certified constants. It prunes a candidate
class of the Gate-A template; it says NOTHING about the uniform `∀ n` bound (= RH). The crux
fields stay `none`.
