F1 square — **the pointwise dilation-covariance of the reciprocal** (`RinvDilate.lean`):

    `s · (1 / (s·y))  ≈  1 / y`     (for `s·y` and `y` positive, via their inverse witnesses)

— the algebraic reason the multiplicative Haar measure `dx/x` is dilation-invariant. Under the
substitution `y = s·x`, the Jacobian factor `s` from `dy = s·dx` exactly cancels the `1/s` from
`1/(s·x)`, leaving the density `1/x` unchanged. This lemma is that cancellation at the point level,
proved from the inverse law `x·(1/x) = 1` (`Rmul_Rinv_self`) by uniqueness of the multiplicative
inverse: both `s·(1/(s·y))` and `1/y` are the inverse of `y`.

HONEST SCOPE. The pointwise density identity only. The integral-level Haar invariance
`∫ φ dx/x = ∫ φ(a·x) dx/x` that assembles this (through the certified change of variables
`riemannIntegralI_dilate` carried across the clamped reciprocal on the window) is the next brick;
it is not here. Not the convolution, not the Mellin theorem. The crux fields stay `none`.

/-- **The pointwise dilation-covariance of the reciprocal** `s · (1/(s·y)) ≈ 1/y`. Both sides are the
    multiplicative inverse of `y`: `y · (s·(1/(s·y))) = (s·y)·(1/(s·y)) = 1 = y·(1/y)`, so they agree
    by uniqueness of the inverse. The inverse witnesses `hk` (for `s·y`) and `hky` (for `y`) carry the
    positivity; a witness for `s·y` can only exist when `s > 0`. -/
