F1 square — **the `t4` archimedean tail, part 1: the compact reciprocal half**
(`T4ArchPieces.lean`). The `t4` arch tail's compact piece integrand on `[1, 4]`
collapses to `2log2/(x+1) − log x/(x−1)`; this file realizes the reciprocal half as
three constructed unit-interval integrals

    `∫_c^{c+1} 2log2/(x+1) dx = ∫₀¹ t4H·(1/((c+1)+t)) dt ≈ t4H·(log(c+2) − log(c+1))`

(`c = 1, 2, 3`, so bases `2, 3, 4`), telescoping to `t4H·(log 5 − log 2)` — instances
of the real-scalar reciprocal engine (`riemannIntegral_recipC_smul`) at the weakened
modulus `L = 5` (the engine's `5(j+1) ≤ midx` schedule needs `L.num ≥ 4`; the natural
constant `2` is too small, so the certificates weaken it — `lip_mono`).

HONEST SCOPE. Three integral evaluations and their telescope; the `log x/(x−1)` half
(the dilog) and the improper remainder are the companion bricks. No slot field, no
positivity. The crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
