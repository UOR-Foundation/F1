F1 square — **the Bernstein basis and partition of unity** (`Bernstein.lean`), the Bernstein arc,
sub-brick B. On the real binomial theorem (`RealBinomial.lean`) the Bernstein basis polynomials

    `bernR x n k = b_{n,k}(x) = C(n,k)·xᵏ·(1−x)ⁿ⁻ᵏ`

are introduced, and their **partition of unity** `Σ_{k=0}^n b_{n,k}(x) = 1` (`bernR_partition`) is
read off the binomial theorem at `(a, b) = (x, 1−x)`, since `x + (1−x) = 1` and `1ⁿ = 1`.

WHY (the Sonine route, step 3, the Mellin FRONT). The Bernstein operator `B_n(φ)(x) = Σ_k φ(k/n)
b_{n,k}(x)` is the constructive approximation engine that general (bounded-Lipschitz) moment determinacy
and Mellin inversion both reduce to; its convergence rests on the three Bernstein moment identities, of
which the partition of unity is the first (and the normalization every later estimate divides by). This
brick pins the basis and that identity; the mean and variance identities follow.

HONEST SCOPE. The Bernstein basis and the partition of unity, over `Real`. Infrastructure for the
determinacy/inversion arc; NOT the mean/variance identities yet, NOT convergence, NOT inversion, NOT
positivity. Step 4 is RH; crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
