F1 square — **the certified dilog lower bound** (`DilogValue.lean`):

    `t4Dilog ≥ 1909/1000 = 1.909`     (true value `∫₁⁴ log x/(x−1) dx = −Li₂(−3) ≈ 1.93939`).

The three piece bounds instantiate `dilogPiece_ge` with the short variation witnesses
`V₀ = 8/25 (≥ 0.3108)`, `V₁ = 3/20 (≥ 0.1490)`, `V₂ = 1/10 (≥ 0.0927)`, each certified against the
exact rational `qVc` by `decide`; the closing inequality is ONE rational `decide` over the three
`16×128`-point folds (outer dyadic level `M = 4`, kernel level `m = 7` — denominators astronomical,
arithmetic exact). No logs, no wedges: the first fully rational bracket of a log-type integral in
the repo.

HONEST SCOPE. A lower bound on the constructed dilog; nothing else. The crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`.
