/-
F1 square — **the bump test's slot integrals, CONSTRUCTED and EVALUATED** (`BumpPieces.lean`):
the three `WeilSlot` interface components of the OFF-CENTER tent with knots `1, 2, 3`
(`f(x) = x−1` on `[1,2]`, `3−x` on `[2,3]` — the first realized test whose support MEETS
the primes; `Square/BumpSlot.lean` assembles the slot):

    `∫₁³ f dx                       ≈ 1`                                   (`bumpPoleA_eq`)
    `∫₁³ f(x)/x dx                  ≈ (1 − log 2) + (3·(log 3 − log 2) − 1)` (`bumpPoleB_eq`)
    `∫₁³ f(x)/(x − x⁻¹) dx          ≈ (1 − (log 3 − log 2))`
                                    `+ ((−1 + log 2) + 2·(log 4 − log 3))` (`bumpArchTail_eq`)

HOW. The pole integrals are the affine/reciprocal pieces over `[1,2]` and `[2,3]` through the
certified gateway. The archimedean tail is COMPACT for this test — `f(1) = 0` kills the
`(2/x)·f(1)` subtraction and the improper remainder past the support — and the PV-cancelled
integrand reduces by exact rational algebra on each piece:
`(x−1)/(x−x⁻¹) = x/(x+1) = 1 − 1/(x+1)` on `[1,2]`, and by partial fractions
`x(3−x)/(x²−1) = −1 + 1/(x−1) + 2/(x+1)` on `[2,3]`. Every reciprocal is totalized with the
floor-1 clamp (inert on the domains) and evaluates through the general-base harmonic bridge
`∫₀¹ dx/(c+x) ≈ log(c+1) − log c` (`HarmonicLogC.lean`).

HONEST SCOPE. Substrate for the crux route's step 2; no positivity claim here. The crux
fields stay `none`.
