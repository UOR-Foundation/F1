/-
F1 square — constant precision: **`λ₃ < λ₄`** (`λ₄ − λ₃ ≥ 0.035`), extending the certified Li
head to `λ₁ < λ₂ < λ₃ < λ₄` and unlocking the order-3 convex-combination Gate-A prune.

WHY THE DIFFERENCE, NOT THE ENDPOINTS. Bounding `λ₄` from below and `λ₃` from above SEPARATELY
does not work (`0.2185 < 0.2486`): each `ηⱼ` bracket width is then paid TWICE, once in each
endpoint, and at the binomial weights `3..6` that doubling swamps the true gap `0.178`. The
difference pays each width once. The archimedean sides, by contrast, are cheap to bound
separately (cost `≈ 0.008` against a `0.047` margin) because their `ζ` weights are small and the
constant `1` cancels exactly — so ONLY the arithmetic side needs an identity:

    λ₄^{arith} − λ₃^{arith} = −(η₀ + 3η₁ + 3η₂ + η₃)      (`lambda4_arith_split`)

obtained from the `nsmulR` splits `4 = 3+1` (definitional), `6 = 3+3`, `4 = 1+3`, and one
7-atom additive rearrangement whose permutation is built STRUCTURALLY (`List.Perm.swap`/`cons`
/`trans`) — `decide` on `List.Perm` is barred, it pulls `Classical.choice`.

THE LEDGER (exact rationals, rounded outward; every input already in stock).
- `η₀ ≤ −0.577`, `3η₁ ≤ 0.596055` (`γ₁ ≤ −0.0677`), `3η₂ ≤ −0.116907699`
  (`γ·γ₁ ≥ 0.578·(−0.0762)`, `γ₂ ≥ −0.014`), and the TIGHT ceiling
  `η₃ ≤ 0.0462725` (`reta3_le_t`: `γ⁴ ≤ 0.578⁴`, `γ²γ₁ ≤ 0.577²·(−0.0677)`,
  `γ₁² ≤ 0.0762²`, `γγ₂ ≤ 0.577·(−0.003)`, `γ₃ ≤ 1/40` — the stock `reta3_le`'s `0.145303`,
  built on the loose `γ₃ ≤ 1/8`, is far too weak here);
  hence `D := η₀ + 3η₁ + 3η₂ + η₃ ≤ −0.0515832 ≤ −0.051`, i.e.
  `λ₄^{arith} − λ₃^{arith} ≥ 0.051`.
- `arch(4) ≥ −1.024325` (`genuineArchSeq4_ge_t`, the ζ(3) ≤ 1.205 sharpening of the stock
  `−1.066325`, which is too weak by `0.042`), `arch(3) ≤ −1.008445` (`genuineArchSeq3_le`),
  so `arch(4) − arch(3) ≥ −0.01588`.
- **`Rlambda3_lt_Rlambda4 : Pos (λ₄ − λ₃)`** with the certified gap `≥ 0.035`
  (true value `0.178`).

HONEST SCOPE. A finite bracket fact about `n ≤ 4`; it prunes one more Gate-A candidate class
and says nothing about the uniform `∀ n` (= RH). The crux fields stay `none`.
