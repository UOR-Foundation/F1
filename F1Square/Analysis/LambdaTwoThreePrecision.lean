F1 square — constant precision: **`λ₂ ≤ 0.1016`** (the THIRD two-sided Li coefficient) and the
**tightened `λ₃ ≥ 0.1436`** (the old certified lower was `0.0584`).

WHY. The order-2 CONTRACTION kill on the Gate-A finite list (`Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`)
refutes `2λ₃ ≈ a₀·2λ₁ + a₁·2λ₂` for all coefficients `≤ 1` by the strict inequality
`λ₁ + λ₂ < λ₃` — which needs `λ₂` from ABOVE (the `log 4π` LOWER consumer, like `λ₁ ≤ 0.02381`)
and `λ₃` from BELOW at better than the `Rlambda3_pos` margin. Ledger:

- `Rlambda2_le` : `λ₂ = 1 + γ − γ² − 2γ₁ − log4π + (3/4)ζ(2)
    ≤ 1 + 0.578 − 0.332929 + 0.1524 − 2.53038 + 0.75·1.646 = 0.101591 ≤ 1016/10⁴`
  (true value `0.0923457`). With `Rlambda2_pos`/`Rlambda2_ge`, `λ₂` is two-sided.
- `Rlambda3_ge` : arithmetic side tightened to `λ₃^{arith} ≥ 1.173914` (the stock
  `Rlambda3_arith_ge_r` gives `1.088713`) using `η₀ ≤ −0.577`, `η₁ ≤ 0.198685` (`reta1_le4`),
  and `η₂ ≤ −γ³ − 3γγ₁ − (3/2)γ₂ ≤ −0.192100033 + 0.1321308 + 0.021 = −0.038969`
  (`Rgamma_cube_ge`, `Rgamma_gamma1_ge`, `Rgamma2_ge_neg0014`); archimedean side reused
  (`archLoR_le : arch(3) ≥ −1.030276`). Total `λ₃ ≥ 0.143638 ≥ 1436/10⁴`
  (true value `0.207639`; the kill budget is `0.02381 + 0.1016 = 0.12541 < 0.1436`).
