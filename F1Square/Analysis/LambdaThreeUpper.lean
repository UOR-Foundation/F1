F1 square — constant precision: **the `λ₃` UPPER bracket** (`λ₃ ≤ 0.2554`; true value
`0.207639`), the second two-sided Li coefficient.

WHY. The Gate-A finite-list prune of the FULL order-1 class (`Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`)
runs through the product identity `(2λ₂)² ≈ (2λ₃)(2λ₁)` forced by any order-1 recurrence; its
refutation needs `4λ₂² > 4λ₃λ₁`, i.e. a `λ₃` UPPER — which in turn needs `log 4π` from BELOW
(`Rlog4pic_ge`, the previous brick: `log 4π` enters `arch(3)` with coefficient `−3/2`, so an
upper on `arch(3)` consumes the LOWER log bracket). A loose upper suffices
(`0.2554 < 0.2668` is the kill budget), but two SHARP ingredients are forced:

- `Rgamma_gamma1_le` — the mixed-sign product upper `γγ₁ ≤ 0.577·(−0.0677) = −0.0390629`:
  its NEGATIVITY is load-bearing (the two-sided `Rmul_le_mul_of_abs` bound `|γγ₁| ≤ 0.044`
  would blow the budget by `0.25`). Route: `γγ₁ ≤ γ·(−0.0677) = −(γ·0.0677) ≤ −(0.577·0.0677)`
  (`Rmul_neg_right` + `Rneg_le`).
- `γ₂ ≤ −3/1000` (`Rgamma2_le_neg0003`, the tight v0.22 bracket): the loose `γ₂ ≤ 1/40`
  costs `0.042` and overshoots the budget.

THE LEDGER (all exact rationals, rounded outward at the ends).
- arithmetic side `λ₃^{arith} = −(3η₀ + 3η₁ + η₂)`:
  `3η₀ ≥ −1.734`, `3η₁ ≥ 3·(0.577² − 0.1524) = 0.541587`,
  `η₂ = −γ³ − 3γγ₁ − (3/2)γ₂ ≥ −0.578³ + 0.1171887 + 0.0045 = −0.071411852 ≥ −0.0714119`,
  so `λ₃^{arith} ≤ 1.2638249` (true `1.22068`).
- archimedean side `arch(3) = 1 − (3/2)(γ + log4π) + (9/4)ζ(2) − (7/8)ζ(3)`:
  `γ + log4π ≥ 0.577 + 2.53038 = 3.10738` (`Rlog4pic_ge`), `ζ(2) ≤ 1.646`, `ζ(3) ≥ 1.201`,
  so `arch(3) ≤ 1 − 4.66107 + 3.7035 − 1.050875 = −1.008445` (true `−1.01308`).
- **`Rlambda3_le : λ₃ ≤ 1.2638249 − 1.008445 = 0.2553799 ≤ 2554/10⁴`.**

With `Rlambda3_pos`, the third Li coefficient is two-sided. HONEST SCOPE: a finite bracket;
the crux fields stay `none`.
