F1 square — **the `t4` archimedean tail, part 2: the improper remainder**
(`T4TailImproper.lean`). The `t4` arch tail's improper piece is
`−4log2·∫₄^∞ dx/(x²−1)`; substituting `x = w + 3` and splitting the partial
fractions, the core object is

    `∫₁^∞ (1/(w+2) − 1/(w+4)) dw ≈ log 5 − log 3`

— the shifted mirror of the tent's `improperTail` (`TentArchTail`): blocks evaluate to
telescoping `logN` differences through `riemannIntegral_recipC_gen` at bases `m+3`,
`m+5`; the partial sums close to `(log(N+3) − log 3) − (log(N+5) − log 5)`; the block
decay is `K = 3` from the per-step log bracket; and the deviation
`log(N+5) − log(N+3) ≤ 2/(N+3)`-shape meets the `K = 3` schedule.

HONEST SCOPE. One improper-integral evaluation; the slot assembly is the companion
brick. No positivity claim. The crux fields stay `none`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; audited by
`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`.
