F1 square — n=5 closure STEP 2-4: `Pos Rlambda5` from the tightened brackets.

Builds ON `LambdaFivePrecision` (STEP 1, the tightened γ₁/γ₂/γ₃ + ζ(3) brackets, IMPORTED here so they
are opaque — matching how `LambdaFourPos` imports its brackets). λ₅^arith lower bound (η-anchor uppers) +
arch(5) lower bound + the `Pos Rlambda5` assembly, mirroring `LambdaFourPos`.

Pure Lean 4 core, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free.
