/-
F1 square — v0.22.0 crux frontier: **`Pos Rlambda4`** (the `n = 4` prime–archimedean coupling
coefficient), the next rung beyond `Pos Rlambda3`.

Assembled from the three tightened constant brackets — `γ₁ ≤ −0.0677` (`Rgamma1_le_neg0677`),
`γ₂ ≤ 1/40` (`Rgamma2_le`), `γ₃ ≤ 1/8` (`Rgamma3_le`) — together with `γ ∈ [0.577,0.578]`,
`γ₂ ≥ −0.02`, `ζ(2) ≥ 1.644`, `ζ(3) ≤ 1.217`, `ζ(4) ≥ 1.082`, `log 4π ≤ 2.5316`.

`λ₄ = λ₄^{arith} + λ₄^{∞}`, `λ₄^{arith} = −(4η₀ + 6η₁ + 4η₂ + η₃)`,
`η₃ = γ⁴ + 4γ²γ₁ + 2γ₁² + 2γγ₂ + (2/3)γ₃`. The η-anchor uppers give `λ₄^{arith} ≥ ≈ +1.0897` and the
archimedean lower (`arch(4) = 1 − 2(γ+log4π) + (9/2)ζ(2) − (7/2)ζ(3) + (15/16)ζ(4)`) gives
`λ₄^{∞} ≥ ≈ −1.0663`, so `λ₄ ≥ ≈ +0.023` (true `λ₄ ≈ 0.370`).  This is `n = 4` ONLY — NOT the crux
(the uniform `∀ n` = RH); `liPositivityHolds` stays `none`, RH open.

/-- Collapse five same-denominator `ofQ` literals and compare in ONE `decide` — the intermediate
    sums stay SYMBOLIC `Int` variables (no kernel reduction of large negatives), so the only
    arithmetic is the final `Qle` `decide`. (The `Radd_ofQ_same` defeq chain on concrete negative
    literals blows up `Int.subNatNat`/`Int.neg`; this routes around it.) -/
