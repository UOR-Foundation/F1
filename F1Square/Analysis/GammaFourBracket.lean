F1 square — stage F: **foundations of the `γ₄` numeric bracket** (the sole remaining `n = 5` gate,
toward `Pos λ₅`), via DISCRETE Euler–Maclaurin (NO constructive integration).

The companion-in-progress of `GammaFour.lean` (which built `γ₄ = Rlim g4SeqDyadic`).  THIS FILE builds
the two foundations the bracket rests on:

  (1) the **quartic log cap** `(ln p)⁴ ≤ 256·p` (`logQuart_le_self256`), completing the
      polynomial-log cap family (`logSq_le_self4`, `logCube_le_self27`); the `(ln p)⁴` factor in the
      bracket's leading `b⁴·C2` term is killed by this cap against the `C2 = Θ(1/p³)` trapezoidal
      smallness, giving a CONSTANT per-step bound `sStep4 ≤ C/(p(p+1))` (no log growth);

  (2) the **further-accelerated sequence** `hSeq4 j = g₄(j) − ½·(ln(j+1))⁴/(j+1)` (`→ γ₄`) and its
      per-step trapezoidal residual `sStep4 = O((ln p)⁴/p³)` (`sStep4`, `hSeq4_step_eq`).

What remains (the documented continuation): the `a = b+δ` decomposition
`decompForm4 = b⁴C2 + b³R2 + b²R1 + b·R0 + R0'` (`sStep4 ≈ decompForm4`, the quartic/quintic-binomial
algebra), the per-step bound `sStep4 ≤ C/(p(p+1))`, the telescope `γ₄ ≤ hSeq4(N) + C/(N+1)`, and the
rational evaluator `decide` — exactly the `GammaThreeBracket` ladder one degree up.
