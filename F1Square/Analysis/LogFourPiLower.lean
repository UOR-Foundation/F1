/-
F1 square — constant precision: **the `log 4π` LOWER bracket** (`log 4π ≥ 2.53038`) and the
first TWO-SIDED Li coefficient (`λ₁ ≤ 0.02381`, joining `Rlambda1_pos`).

WHY. The substrate carried only UPPER log brackets (`Rlog2c_le`, `Rlogπc_le` — built for the
λ-positivity proofs, where `log 4π` enters negatively) plus the crude `log π ≥ 1`
(`LogPiLower`). Every λ UPPER bound needs the complement — `log 4π` from BELOW — and λ upper
bounds are what the Gate-A finite-list prunes consume next (the general order-1 class
`(K, a) = (1, c)` dies on `λ₃λ₁ ≉ λ₂²`, which needs λ uppers; `Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`).
This brick supplies the missing side with the same certified-series discipline:

- `artSum_le_base` — NEW substrate lemma: the artanh partial sum is monotone in the BASE
  (via `qpow_le_base`), the lower-side companion of the dominance used by `Rlogπc_le`.
- `Rpi_seq_ge_314` — every Machin approximant is `≥ 3.14`: the depth-6 sharpening of
  `Rpi_seq_ge_three` (`arctan(1/5) ≥ 0.197354`, `arctan(1/239) ≤ 0.004226`, tail `(1/2)¹⁵`),
  giving `π_seq ≥ 16·0.197354 − 4·0.004226 = 3.14076`.
- `tmap_ge_314` — `q ≥ 314/100 ⟹ (q−1)/(q+1) ≥ 107/207` (the cleared form is exactly
  `100·q ≥ 314`), hence `RpiTmap.seq n ≥ 107/207` pointwise (`RpiTmap_ge_107207`).
- `Rlog2c_ge_69314` — `log 2 ≥ 0.69314`: the artanh(1/3) partial sum at depth 8 is a LOWER
  bound (all terms positive; `artSum_mono` + the reindex `Rartanh_R (1/3) m = 21(m+1) ≥ 8`).
- `Rlogpic_ge_11441` — `log π ≥ 1.1441`: `artanh(RpiTmap) ≥ artSum(107/207, 5)` by
  base-monotonicity + depth-monotonicity (`Rartanh_R (15/29) m = 957(m+1) ≥ 5`).
- `Rlog4pic_ge` — **`log 4π ≥ 253038/100000 = 2.53038`** (true value `2.531024`).
- `Rtwolambda1_le` / **`Rlambda1_le`** — `2λ₁ = 2 + γ − log4π ≤ 0.04762`, so
  **`λ₁ ≤ 2381/100000 = 0.02381`** (true value `0.0230957`): with `Rlambda1_pos`, the first
  Li coefficient is now bracketed two-sidedly. This is the enabling bracket for the
  next Gate-A class prunes (λ-upper-side arithmetic).

HONEST SCOPE. Finite certified brackets; no positivity claim beyond `n = 1`; the crux
fields stay `none` (the uniform `∀ n` = RH is untouched).
