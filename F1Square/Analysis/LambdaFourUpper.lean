/-
F1 square — constant precision: **the `λ₄` UPPER bracket** (`λ₄ ≤ 0.563`; true value
`0.385812`), the FOURTH two-sided Li coefficient (joining `Rlambda4_pos`).

WHY. The surviving Gate-A candidate frontier after the four prunes is order-2 with a
coefficient `> 1`; its kill is the 3×3 Hankel determinant on `λ₁..λ₅`, which needs ALL FIVE
coefficients two-sided. `λ₄` is the last one whose upper is assemblable from current stock
(`λ₅`'s upper runs through the unbuilt `γ₄` upper). This brick completes it, adding the four
product LOWER bounds the `η₃` floor needs — each the `ge`-mirror of an existing upper:

- `Rgamma_pow4_ge`      : `γ⁴ ≥ 0.577⁴` (from `Rgamma_cube_ge`);
- `Rgamma_sq_gamma1_ge` : `γ²γ₁ ≥ 0.578²·(−0.0762)` (mixed sign — the floor needs the
  PRODUCT of the outer bounds, via the `Rmul_neg_right` route of `Rgamma_gamma1_le`);
- `Rgamma1_sq_ge`       : `γ₁² ≥ 0.0677²` (square of the certified magnitude, via the
  double-negation identity `γ₁² = (−γ₁)²`);
- `Rgamma_gamma2_ge`    : `γγ₂ ≥ 0.578·(−0.014)`.

THE LEDGER (exact rationals, rounded outward).
- `η₃ = γ⁴ + 4γ²γ₁ + 2γ₁² + 2γγ₂ + (2/3)γ₃
     ≥ 0.110841719 − 0.101828803 + 0.00916658 − 0.016184 − 1/30 ≥ −0.0313379`;
- `λ₄^{arith} = −(4η₀ + 6η₁ + 4η₂ + η₃)`: with `4η₀ ≥ −2.312`, `6η₁ ≥ 1.083174`,
  `4η₂ ≥ −0.2856476` (the `LambdaThreeUpper` floors), `λ₄^{arith} ≤ 1.5458115`;
- `arch(4) = 1 − 2(γ + log4π) + (9/2)ζ(2) − (7/2)ζ(3) + (15/16)ζ(4)
     ≤ 1 − 6.21476 + 7.407 − 4.2035 + 1.0284375 = −0.9828225` (the `log 4π` LOWER consumer);
- **`Rlambda4_le : λ₄ ≤ 1.5458115 − 0.9828225 = 0.562989 ≤ 563/1000`.**
