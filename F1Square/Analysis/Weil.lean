F1 square — v0.19.0 (the genuine-pairing arc), brick W1: **THE WEIL FUNCTIONAL'S
CONSTRUCTED COMPONENTS** — the finite-place side and the archimedean constant, assembled
from built objects on an explicit constructive test class. No zeros as inputs.

THE NORMALIZATION (pinned; deep-research-verified verbatim against the primary PDFs —
99 agents, 21 claims 3-0). We use the UNSYMMETRIZED Connes–Consani printing (arXiv
2006.13771 Appendix B; published Selecta Math. 27 (2021) art. 77 — equation numbers
differ by one between editions, we cite the arXiv numbering):
  • the explicit formula:  `Σ_ρ f̃(ρ) = f̃(1) + f̃(0) − Σ_v W_v(f)`,  `f̃(s) = ∫₀^∞ f(x)x^{s−1}dx`;
  • the finite places (eq. 149):  `W_p(f) = (log p)·Σ_{m≥1} (f(pᵐ) + f^♯(pᵐ))`,
    `f^♯(x) = x⁻¹·f(x⁻¹)`  —  summed over primes:  `Σ_n Λ(n)·(f(n) + n⁻¹·f(1/n))`,
    RATIONAL weights (the `p^{−m/2}` weights belong to the shifted/symmetric Burnol
    normalization, math/0101068 Thm 2.1 — a different, verified printing; MIXING THEM is
    the convention trap, as is the involution `ǧ(x) = conj g(1/x)` under `dx/x` vs
    `x⁻¹·conj g(1/x)` under `dx`, and the archimedean constant `log 4π + γ` here vs
    `log 2π + γ` there);
  • the archimedean place (eq. 150):
    `W_ℝ(f) = (log 4π + γ)·f(1) + ∫₁^∞ (f(x) + f^♯(x) − (2/x)f(1)) dx/(x − x⁻¹)`
    — a principal value tamed by the `f(1)`-subtraction; for `supp f ⊂ [1/X, X]` the
    `f`-part of the integral ranges over `[1, X]` only, but when `f(1) ≠ 0` the
    subtracted tail extends past `X` with an elementary closed form — NOT truncatable
    at the support edge (the verified caveat).

WHAT IS CONSTRUCTED HERE (no hedge): on a test datum `f : ℚ → Real` with support cutoff
`X` (the evaluations the components consume are at rational points only — exactly right
for piecewise-linear test functions with rational breakpoints, which are ADMISSIBLE to
Weil's criterion directly: Bombieri's class `W` (the official Clay problem description,
§V) requires only piecewise-`C¹` with averaged jumps and `O(x^δ)/O(x^{−1−δ})` decay):
  • `weilPrimePart` — THE WHOLE FINITE-PLACE SIDE: the finite sum
    `Σ_{n≤X} Λ(n)·(f(n) + n⁻¹·f(1/n))` (finite because `supp f ⊂ [1/X, X]`;
    `weilPrimePart_stable` proves the sum is constant past the cutoff — the same
    discipline as `primeSide_stable`);
  • `weilArchConst` — the archimedean constant term `(log 4π + γ)·f(1)`: both factors
    built (`Rlog4pic` v0.14.0, `Rgamma_h` v0.14.0).
WHAT REMAINS INTERFACE (the faithful boundary): the archimedean INTEGRAL and the pole
terms `f̃(1) + f̃(0)` are integrals of `f`; for piecewise-polynomial `f` with rational
breakpoints their reduction to closed forms (rational combinations of logarithms) is
ROUTINE BUT UNVERIFIED IN PRINT (the deep-research open question) — transcribing an
unverified reduction would breach the gate, so they enter the pairing as interface data
(`Square/Pairing.lean`), never fabricated.

THE CRITERION this feeds (stated at the pairing level): `RH ⟺ W(g ⋆ g^τ) ≥ 0` for all
test `g` — ELEMENTARY in both directions (Weil 1952; Burnol arXiv math/9810169 proves
the Lemma directly, "rather than applying a suitable density argument"; the C.R. note
math/0101068: "il est élémentaire que l'Hypothèse de Riemann équivaut à: Z(k) ≥ 0").
