F1 square — Track 1, item 3: the **theta modular relation as a labelled seam** — the single
Poisson-summation atom the completed-zeta functional equation rests on, now *expressible* in the
constructive language (it was not before: it needs the theta function below `t = 1`, `thetaFnPos`,
and the real-radicand square root `RsqrtReal`, both built in this layer).

For the half theta `ψ(t) = Σ_{n≥1} e^{−πn²t}` the Jacobi modular transformation is
`ψ(1/t) = (√t − 1)/2 + √t·ψ(t)` — equivalent to `ϑ(1/t) = √t·ϑ(t)` for the full theta
`ϑ = 1 + 2ψ`. We state it as a predicate `ThetaModular` (over `t ≥ 1`, its reciprocal `u = 1/t`,
and the real √), matching the program's labelled-seam style (`CompletedZetaFE`, the `HadamardXi`
seams): the genuine analytic content (Poisson summation / Gaussian self-duality) is carried as this
explicit, audit-visible hypothesis, never an axiom. The remaining bridge — the Mellin transform of
this relation yielding `CompletedZetaFE` — sits on the certified `halfLineIntegral` already built.

/-- **The theta modular relation (labelled Poisson seam)** `ψ(1/t) = (√t − 1)/2 + √t·ψ(t)` for the
    half theta `ψ`, with `t ≥ 1`, `u = 1/t` (`t·u = 1`, `u ≥ 1/Dᵤ`), and `√t = RsqrtReal t`. This is
    the constructive face of Poisson summation — the one analytic atom item-3's `CompletedZetaFE`
    reduces to once the Mellin step (over `halfLineIntegral`) is carried out. -/
