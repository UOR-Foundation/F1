F1 square — **the tent test's `f̃(0)` Weil-slot component, CONSTRUCTED and EVALUATED**
(`TentLogPiece.lean`):

    `∫_{1/2}^{1} (2 − 1/x) dx + ∫_{1}^{2} (2/x − 1) dx  ≈  log 2`   (`tentPoleB_eq`)

— the `∫₀^∞ f(x)/x dx` part of the pole term for the piecewise-linear tent test (knots
`1/2, 1, 2`; the `X = 2` prime-free window). With `tentPoleA_eq` (`∫ f = 3/4`) this completes
the tent's pole block `f̃(1) + f̃(0) = 3/4 + log 2` — the second `WeilSlot` interface integral
reduced in the kernel rather than carried as data.

HOW. The reciprocal integrands are totalized by the `clampedInv` gadget with the floor-1 clamp
throughout — on `[1/2, 1]` via the identity `1/x = 2·(1/(2x))` (`2x ∈ [1,2]`, so the SAME
`clampedInv 1` realizes both pieces; no second clamp floor, no scaling identity needed). Both
affine pullbacks are then POINTWISE `≈` to affine combinations of the harmonic integrand
`gRecip t = 1/max(1+t,1)`:

    piece 1 pullback:  `2 − 2·gRecip t`     piece 2 pullback:  `2·gRecip t − 1`,

so `riemannIntegral_congr` + the gateway's linearity (`_const/_smul/_neg/_add`) reduce both
values to `∫₀¹ dx/(1+x) ≈ log 2` (`HarmonicLog.lean`): piece 1 `= (1/2)(2 − 2·log 2) = 1 − log 2`,
piece 2 `= 2·log 2 − 1`, sum `= log 2`.

HONEST SCOPE. Substrate for the crux route's steps 1–2; no positivity, no crux claim. The
crux fields stay `none`.
