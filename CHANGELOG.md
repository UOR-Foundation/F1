## [Unreleased]

Post-v0.21.0 research thread — the constructive **RH witness**, the **ξ-zero symmetry group**, the
**Bombieri–Lagarias pipeline** wiring the witness to the genuine `λ` (Li's criterion, both
directions), the **arithmetic Hodge index ⟺ RH** equivalence stated about the *constructed* ζ, the
**Voros off-line** analysis, and the **Burnol-multiplier obstruction** — the Riemann–Siegel angle's
non-monotone window and its capstone `α(2) < 0` (the archimedean multiplier is pointwise *indefinite*,
so single-place positivity provably does not extend — the obstruction, never a false `α ≥ 0`). All
axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free; the no-smuggling audit
passes; the crux fields stay `none` (RH open throughout — every classical input is an explicit,
audit-visible hypothesis, never an axiom).

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 86 — THE MELLIN TRANSFORM RESPECTS NEGATION AND SUBTRACTION** (new
  `Square/MellinLinearNeg.lean`): `(−φ)^(n) ≈ −φ̂(n)` (`mellinHat_neg` — moment by `innerI_neg_left`,
  twisted window by `riemannIntegralI_neg` = `twTerm_neg`, tail by `genSum_Rneg_of_termwise` +
  `Rlim_neg` = `twTail_neg`) and `(φ−ψ)^(n) ≈ φ̂(n) − ψ̂(n)` (`mellinHat_sub`, composing add+neg
  through `L2Test.sub = add _ (neg _)`). With `mellinHat_add`, the transform's linear structure is
  complete, so the transform-side vanishing conditions (`HatVanishes`) cut out genuine linear
  **sub**spaces of the test class. **Honest scope**: the transform's linearity at the integer sample
  points `f̂(n)` on the decaying-test class — not the continuous Mellin parameter, the transform
  *pair*, or inversion, which remain open. Nothing touches the Weil form; step 4 is RH; crux fields
  stay `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 85 — THE THREE FLAGSHIP LEVEL-3 MEMBERS ARE PAIRWISE-DISTINCT
  FUNCTIONS ON `[0,1]`** (new `Square/CoSupportPairwise.lean`): brick 84's bridge across all three
  pairs — `deep3`/`deep4` and `deep3`/`deep5` differ at the third moment (`−1/2520` vs `0`),
  `deep4`/`deep5` at the fourth (`1/13860` vs `0`) — bundled as `deep345_pairwise_distinct_on_unit`.
  So the moment-table independence (`deep345_independent`) is fully upgraded to a function-level
  statement for the realized triple. **Honest scope**: pairwise distinctness (each pair does not
  agree everywhere — the constructive negation), weaker than function-level linear independence of
  the triple; realized members only. Nothing touches the Weil form; step 4 is RH; crux fields stay
  `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 84 — DISTINCT CO-SUPPORT LEVELS ARE DISTINCT FUNCTIONS ON
  `[0,1]`** (new `Square/CoSupportDistinct.lean`): the reusable bridge
  `distinct_on_unit_of_moment_ne` — two tests whose *difference* carries a nonzero moment cannot
  agree pointwise on `[0,1]` (metric iff brick 82 + moment bridge brick 63). Applied to the
  filtration: `deep3` (level 3, third moment `−1/2520`) and `deep4` (level 4, third moment `0`)
  differ in `⟨deep3−deep4, x³⟩ = −1/2520 ≠ 0`, hence are genuinely distinct **functions** on `[0,1]`
  (`deep3_deep4_distinct_on_unit`) — the moment-table independence (`deep345_independent`) upgraded
  to function level. **Honest scope**: `¬ (∀ x ∈ [0,1], φ(x) ≈ ψ(x))` — "do not agree everywhere",
  the constructive negation, not a constructed point of disagreement; realized members only. Nothing
  touches the Weil form; step 4 is RH; crux fields stay `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 83 — THE CO-SUPPORT MEMBERS ARE GENUINELY NONZERO FUNCTIONS ON
  `[0,1]`** (new `Square/CoSupportFunction.lean`): the function-level upgrade the definiteness iff
  unlocks. A test with nonzero `L²` self-energy cannot vanish identically on `[0,1]`
  (`not_vanishing_of_innerI_self_not_zero`, the `.mpr` of `innerI_self_zero_iff_unit_zero`
  contraposed). Chained against the certified `Pos` moment-energy (`momentL2Sq_zero_of_innerI...`
  contrapositive), `deep3` (`deep3_not_vanishing_on_unit`) and the whole `combo345 a b c` family with
  `a ≥ 1` (`combo345_not_vanishing_on_unit`) are honestly nonzero **functions** on `[0,1]` — the
  filtration's distinct levels are now witnessed by tests that genuinely differ *as functions* there,
  not merely in their moments.
  - **Honest scope**: `¬ (∀ x ∈ [0,1], φ(x) ≈ 0)` — "does not vanish identically", the constructive
    negation of universal vanishing, NOT a constructed point of non-vanishing. The co-support
    skeleton's positivity is still diagonal-multiplier level only. Nothing touches the Weil form;
    step 4 is RH; crux fields stay `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 82 — THE `L²` DISTANCE IS A GENUINE METRIC ON `[0,1]`** (new
  `Square/L2MetricIff.lean`): the two-directional separation iff
  (`dist2I_zero_iff_pointwise_eq`): `dist2I φ ψ ≈ 0 ⟺ ∀ x ∈ [0,1], φ(x) ≈ ψ(x)`. Brick 80 forward
  (separation) + brick 81 reverse (definiteness) applied to the difference test `L2Test.sub φ ψ`
  (whose value at `x` is `φ(x) − ψ(x)` definitionally). So the `L²` distance-squared vanishes
  **exactly** on the pointwise-`[0,1]`-equality relation — a genuine metric there, zero set neither
  coarser nor finer than pointwise agreement. **Honest scope**: the separation iff on `[0,1]`, not a
  full isometry, not the moment problem. Nothing touches the Weil form; step 4 is RH; crux fields
  stay `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 81 — `⟨φ,φ⟩` IS A DEFINITE INNER PRODUCT ON `[0,1]`** (new
  `Square/L2DefiniteIff.lean`): the reverse of brick 79, closing definiteness to an **iff**
  (`innerI_self_zero_iff_unit_zero`): `∫₀¹ φ² ≈ 0 ⟺ ∀ x ∈ [0,1], φ(x) ≈ 0`. The new direction — a
  test vanishing at every point of `[0,1]` has zero `L²` energy (`innerI_self_zero_of_unit_zero`) —
  goes through a **`[0,1]`-restricted** integral argument: the certified Riemann sums sample only the
  rational partition points `i/(N+1) ∈ [0,1)`, so an integrand vanishing there has every Riemann sum
  zero, hence every dyadic sum, hence the telescoping limit zero
  (`riemannIntegral_zero_of_partition_zero`, via `riemannSum_congr` + `RsumN_const` +
  `genSum_telescope` + `Rlim_zero`). The generic congruence lemmas quantify over *all* reals and are
  unusable here (the converse is false off `[0,1]`, where the integral is blind), so the
  partition-restricted lemma is the load-bearing new piece.
  - Together the two directions make the `L²` seminorm a genuine **norm** on the bounded-Lipschitz
    class mod pointwise-`[0,1]` equality: the pairing is positive-**definite**. **Honest scope**:
    still not the moment problem (a nonzero test with every *moment* vanishing needs Bernstein).
    Nothing touches the Weil form; step 4 is RH; crux fields stay `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 80 — THE `L²` INNER PRODUCT SEPARATES POINTS OF `[0,1]`** (new
  `Square/L2Separation.lean`): two tests at `L²` distance zero agree at every point of `[0,1]`
  (`dist2I_zero_imp_pointwise_eq`) — brick 79's point-definiteness applied to the difference test
  (`dist2I φ ψ = ⟨φ−ψ, φ−ψ⟩`, so `≈ 0` forces `(φ−ψ)(x) ≈ 0`, and `(φ−ψ)(x) = φ(x) − ψ(x)`
  definitionally). The `L²` class thereby **injects into the values on `[0,1]`**: the pairing's null
  relation is pointwise equality there, so the completion axis is a genuine *pre-Hilbert* structure,
  not merely semi-normed. Specialized to the polynomial class in `polyPN_dist2I_zero_imp_eq`.
  - **Honest scope**: one direction, on `[0,1]` only — separation (injectivity into functions on
    `[0,1]`), not a full isometry. The converse (agree on `[0,1]` ⟹ `dist2I ≈ 0`) is the
    integral-of-a-vanishing-integrand direction, false off `[0,1]` and needing a `[0,1]`-restricted
    argument not performed. Nothing touches the Weil form; step 4 is RH; crux fields stay `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 79 — DEFINITENESS AT EVERY POINT OF `[0,1]`** (new
  `Square/DyadicDenseReal.lean`): every unit-interval real is dyadically approximable
  (`dyadicApproximable_of_unit`), discharging brick 76's `DyadicApproximable` hypothesis for an
  **arbitrary** `x ∈ [0,1]`. So `∫₀¹ φ² ≈ 0 ⟹ φ(x) ≈ 0` at **every** point
  (`innerI_self_zero_imp_zero`), and a polynomial test with `d` vanishing moments is the zero
  **function** on `[0,1]` (`polyPN_unit_zero`) — brick 64's moment-determinacy upgraded to a
  function-level determinacy on the polynomial class.
  - The mechanism is the one bricks 68–78 assembled: locate the real's own rational approximant
    `x.seq N` to within `1/(N+1)` (`Rabs_sub_seq_le`), floor it to a dyadic point (brick 75), clamp
    the index into range (brick 77), transport the vanishing value by the Lipschitz certificate
    (brick 76). The one genuinely new ingredient is the **out-of-range case analysis**: the
    approximant need not lie in `[0,1)`, so when it dips below `0` or reaches `1` the clamped point
    sits at the boundary and the distance is bounded there directly from `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` (`case_lo`,
    `case_hi`), not through the floor (`case_mid`). This is what the brick-78 note flagged as the one
    remaining, purely-mechanical step; it is now performed.
  - **Honest scope**: point-definiteness at every real point of `[0,1]` — a statement about the
    value of a bounded-Lipschitz test at a point, **not** the moment problem. A nonzero test with
    every *moment* vanishing is a different question, still open, still needing a constructive
    approximation theorem (Bernstein) the repo does not have. Nothing touches the Weil form; step 4
    is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 78 — DEFINITENESS AT EVERY RATIONAL POINT** (new
  `Square/DyadicDense.lean`): the rationals of `[0,1)` are dyadically approximable
  (`dyadicApproximable_ofQ` — brick 75's floor + brick 77's clamp + `2^m` outrunning any rational
  via `exists_depth`), which **discharges brick 76's `DyadicApproximable` hypothesis on the
  rationals**. So `∫₀¹ φ² ≈ 0 ⟹ φ(q) ≈ 0` at every rational `q ∈ [0,1)`
  (`innerI_self_zero_imp_rational_zero`), and brick 64's polynomial determinacy reaches the
  **function** on a dense point set (`polyPN_rational_zero`). Every step is a `ℚ` computation; no
  real is compared to anything.
  - This is a strict strengthening of brick 74 (dyadic points → all rationals). The extension to
    **all** reals is now purely mechanical in shape — `Rabs_sub_seq_le` plus the triangle
    inequality, with the out-of-range approximant handled by a decidable case split — but is **not**
    performed here.
  - Honest scope: definiteness at every rational point, still not all points, and it says nothing
    about the moment problem (a nonzero test with all *moments* vanishing, still open, still needs
    Bernstein).

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 77 — THE CLAMPED DYADIC INDEX** (new `Square/DyadicClamp.lean`):
  the second piece brick 76 named as missing. Brick 75's floor `⌊q·2^m⌋` lands in `[0, 2^m)` only
  when `q` is already in `[0,1)`, but the density argument feeds it the approximants `x.seq N` of a
  real `x ∈ [0,1]`, which need **not** be in range. `dyadJC q m := min (⌊q·2^m⌋) (2^m − 1)` caps
  it; `dyadJC_lt` is unconditional, and `dyadJC_approx` shows the clamp is inert in range so brick
  75's estimate survives.
  - Honest scope: the clamped index and its range bound only. It does **not** prove the
    approximation quality of the clamped point for an *out-of-range* `q` — that needs the
    (decidable) case analysis on `q` below `0` / in range / at-or-above `1`, which is not carried
    out. So `DyadicApproximable` is **still not discharged** and brick 74's definiteness remains
    stated at dyadic points.

- **Substrate — A REAL IS WITHIN `1/(N+1)` OF ITS OWN APPROXIMANT** (new
  `Analysis/RSeqApprox.lean`): `|x − ofQ (x.seq N)| ≤ 1/(N+1)` (`Rabs_sub_seq_le`, and the flipped
  orientation `Rabs_seq_sub_le`). One of the two pieces brick 76 named as missing. It says a Bishop
  real's rational data is an *effective* approximation with a known rate, which is what makes the
  density argument possible: one cannot locate a real by comparison, but one can read off a
  rational within a prescribed distance and locate **that**, which is decidable. Definitional
  unwinding plus regularity — `Rsub x (ofQ q)` reads at `2n+1`, and the slack `1/(2n+2) ≤ 2/(n+1)`
  closes it.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 76 — THE TRANSPORT HALF OF DENSITY** (new
  `Square/L2DefiniteDensity.lean`): brick 74 gave `∫₀¹ φ² ≈ 0 ⟹ φ(p) ≈ 0` at dyadic `p`; this
  carries the value to any point the dyadics approximate.
  - `abs_le_of_near_dyadic`: `|φ(x)| ≤ L·|x − p|` — one line of Lipschitz, since `φ(p) ≈ 0`.
  - `zero_of_dyadic_approximable`: if every rate is met by some dyadic point, `φ(x) ≈ 0`, by the
    Archimedean criterion.
  - What this buys is that the remaining work is now a **single, purely metric** statement with no
    analysis in it: `DyadicApproximable x`. Non-vacuous (`dyadicApproximable_dyadPt`).
  - **Honest scope — what is and is not proven.** `zero_of_dyadic_approximable` is stated *under*
    `DyadicApproximable x` as a **hypothesis, not discharged here** for general `x ∈ [0,1]`. So
    this brick does **not** by itself upgrade brick 74 from dyadic points to all points.
    Discharging it needs two things the repo still lacks: a bound `|x − ofQ (x.seq N)| ≤ 1/(N+1)`
    relating a real to its own approximants, and a clamp of `⌊q·2^m⌋` into `[0, 2^m)` for a
    rational that may sit slightly outside `[0,1)` (brick 75 supplies the floor but assumes the
    rational is already in range). Until both land, the definiteness statement of record remains
    `innerI_self_zero_imp_dyadic_zero`, at dyadic points.

- **Certified integration, brick 75 — EVERY RATIONAL HAS A DYADIC POINT WITHIN `1/2^m`** (new
  `Square/DyadicApprox.lean`): `0 ≤ q`, `q.num.toNat < q.den` gives `j = ⌊q·2^m⌋ < 2^m` with
  `|q − j/2^m| ≤ 1/2^m` (`dyadJ_lt`, `dyadApprox_spec`) — the constructive floor the density
  extension of brick 74 was missing.
  - **This is where the constructivity actually lives.** One cannot locate a *real* (given `x`
    there is no deciding `x ≤ 1/2`), but one *can* locate a *rational*, because `ℚ` has decidable
    order and `ℕ` division is computable. Every real carries rational approximants `x.seq N` of
    known accuracy, so locating the rational suffices.
  - The witness is `ℕ` division and its correctness is the division algorithm and nothing else:
    `d·j + r = n·2^m` with `r < d` *is* `|q − j/2^m| ≤ 1/2^m` after clearing denominators.
  - Two gate catches, both `Classical.choice` leaks that `lake build` accepted and `#print axioms`
    rejected: **`omega` reasons classically about `n / d` when the divisor is a variable**, and
    `Nat.lt_of_mul_lt_mul_left` is itself choice-dependent. Both replaced by explicit choice-free
    steps (`bracket_core`'s two `calc`s; a `Nat.lt_or_ge` split for the cancellation).
  - Honest scope: the **rational** half of the density argument, complete and self-contained. The
    assembly — pushing it through `x.seq N` to a real `x`, then through `sq_ge_on_piece_near` to
    conclude `φ(x) ≈ 0` for every `x ∈ [0,1]` — is **not** performed. Until it is, brick 74's
    definiteness remains stated at dyadic points.

- **Toward density (in `Square/L2Definite.lean`)** — `sq_ge_on_piece_near`: brick 74's piece lemma
  with the hypothesis `ofQ A ≈ p` weakened to `|ofQ A − p| ≤ W`, the drop across the piece becoming
  `2·Lg·W`. This is the reusable half of the extension from dyadic points to **all** points: for a
  general real `x` one cannot ask for a dyadic endpoint *equal* to `x`, only for one within a
  chosen width. The extension itself is **not** done — it additionally needs a constructive
  rational-to-dyadic floor (`j := ⌊q·2^m⌋` on a rational approximant of `x`, computable since `ℚ`
  has decidable order, then clamped into `[0, 2^m)`), which is not built.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 74 — THE L² INNER PRODUCT IS DEFINITE AT DYADIC POINTS** (new
  `Square/L2Definite.lean`): `φ(j/2^m)² > 0 ⟹ ∫₀¹ φ² > 0` (`innerI_self_pos_of_dyadic`), hence
  `∫₀¹ φ² ≈ 0` forces `φ` to vanish at every dyadic point of `[0,1)`
  (`innerI_self_zero_imp_dyadic_zero`). This is what the locality chain of bricks 68–73 was for.
  - **The constructive point.** A definiteness argument classically picks a neighbourhood of a
    point where `|φ|` is large; constructively one may not *locate* a real, since given `x₀` there
    is no deciding whether `x₀ ≤ 1/2`. Restricting to **dyadic** points dissolves this: `p = j/2^m`
    already *is* a dyadic endpoint, so the piece is the depth-`(M+m)` interval at index `j·2^M`,
    computed entirely in `ℕ`. No order on reals is decided anywhere.
  - The rest is arithmetic on `g = φ·φ`, already certified with modulus `l2L φ φ`: `Pos (g p)`
    gives a rational `a > 0` below it (`Pos_imp_ofQ_le`); the depth is chosen so the Lipschitz drop
    across the piece is `≤ a/2` (`exists_depth`, via `Nat.lt_two_pow_self`), leaving `g ≥ a/2`
    there (`sq_ge_on_piece`); brick 73 converts that into `Pos (∫₀¹ g)`.
  - **Brick 64 is upgraded on the polynomial class** (`polyPN_dyadic_zero`): a `d`-coefficient
    polynomial test with `d` vanishing moments is zero at every dyadic point — determinacy at the
    level of the *function*, not only its moments. `PolyDeterminacy.lean`'s scope note is corrected
    accordingly (it had said the pointwise step was unreachable for want of interval splitting;
    bricks 68–73 supply exactly that, so the note was stale).
  - Honest scope: definiteness **at dyadic points**. Extending to every real point is a density
    argument and is **not** performed here; nor is the moment problem — this says nothing about
    whether a nonzero test can have all *moments* vanishing, which still needs Bernstein.

- **Certified integration, brick 73 — A POINTWISE BOUND ON A PIECE IS A NUMERIC BOUND ON THE
  INTEGRAL** (new `Square/IntervalMinorant.lean`): `c ≤ g` on `[a, a+w]` gives
  `w·c ≤ ∫_a^{a+w} g` (`riemannIntegralI_ge_const`), plus `riemannIntegralI_unit` identifying
  `∫_0^{0+1}` with the plain `∫₀¹`. Composed with brick 72: **a positive constant on one dyadic
  piece forces the whole integral positive** (`riemannIntegral_pos_of_piece`).
  - The comparison used is the **local** one (`riemannIntegralI_le_unit`), needing `c ≤ g` only on
    the affine image of `[0,1]` — i.e. only on the piece. That locality is the whole point: the
    bound is available on the small interval and nowhere else.
  - Honest scope: this consumes a piece and a certified bound on it and produces the integral
    bound. It does **not** produce them. For `L²` definiteness one still has to choose the dyadic
    depth from the Lipschitz constant and the size of `|φ|` at the point — the arithmetic step,
    not done here.

- **Certified integration, brick 72 — EVERY DYADIC SUB-INTERVAL LOWER-BOUNDS THE WHOLE** (new
  `Square/DyadicDescent.lean`): for a non-negative integrand and `j < 2^m`,
  `∫_{a+j·w/2^m}^{a+(j+1)·w/2^m} f ≤ ∫_a^{a+w} f` (`riemannIntegralI_ge_dyadic`) — the induction
  bricks 70 and 71 were built for, and the form "positive on a piece ⟹ positive overall" has to
  take before it is usable, since the piece may be **arbitrarily small**.
  - The induction is on the depth: at depth `m+1` the index splits as `j = 2q` or `j = 2q+1`, and
    the interval is exactly the left or right half of the depth-`m` interval at `q`, so brick 71's
    one-step bound applies and the hypothesis finishes. Brick 71's `riemannIntegralI_congr_Q`
    bridges the two computed endpoint forms.
  - Mechanically: `j` occurs inside the denominator-positivity **proof terms** the statement
    carries, so it is eliminated by `subst` (obtained from `∃ q, j = 2q ∨ j = 2q+1`) and never by
    `rw`, which would not be type-correct; the depth is moved by `Nat.pow_succ` inside the `Qeq`
    goals only, where no proof terms live.
  - Honest scope: a lower bound by **one** dyadic sub-interval. This is not a subdivision identity
    (the pieces are never summed), and it is **not yet** `L²` definiteness: that still needs the
    constructive location step — choosing the piece around a point of non-vanishing using only
    rational comparisons, never a decidable order on reals.

- **Certified integration, brick 71 — A HALF LOWER-BOUNDS ITS INTERVAL, AND ENDPOINTS ONLY
  MATTER UP TO `Qeq`** (new `Square/IntervalPiece.lean`): the general form of brick 69, plus the
  congruence an induction over dyadic descents actually needs.
  - `riemannIntegralI_ge_left_half` / `_ge_right_half`: for a non-negative integrand each half of
    `[a, a+w]` lower-bounds it — brick 70's split with the other half thrown away.
  - `riemannIntegralI_congr_Q`: interval integrals depend on `(a, w)` only through `Qeq`. This was
    quietly missing and blocks any descent on its own: a descent computes `a + 2q·w/2^{m+1}` on one
    route and `a + q·w/2^m` on the other, which are equal **rationals** but not equal **terms**, so
    the two sides of an induction could not be connected at all. It follows from brick 70's
    `riemannIntegral_congr_mod` — the pulled-back integrands agree pointwise and the moduli `L·w`,
    `L·w'` are `Qeq`-equal.
  - Honest scope: the one-step bound and the endpoint congruence. The descent to a depth-`m` dyadic
    sub-interval is the induction these support and is **not** performed here.

- **Certified integration, brick 70 — EVERY INTERVAL SPLITS AT ITS MIDPOINT** (new
  `Square/IntervalSplit.lean`): `∫_a^{a+w} f ≈ ∫_a^{a+w/2} f + ∫_{a+w/2}^{a+w} f`
  (`riemannIntegralI_split_half`). Brick 68 split `[0,1]`; this is the general law, and iterating
  it reaches every dyadic sub-interval of every interval.
  - The mechanism is that the affine pullbacks **compose**: `α_{a,w} ∘ α_{0,1/2} = α_{a,w/2}` and
    `α_{a,w} ∘ α_{1/2,1/2} = α_{a+w/2,w/2}` (`affineMap_half_left`, `affineMap_half_right`). So
    brick 68 applied to `f ∘ α_{a,w}` already produces the two half-interval integrands — once the
    certificate moduli `(L·w)·½` and `L·(w/2)` are reconciled. They are `Qeq`-equal but not
    syntactically equal, and that reconciliation is the reusable half of the brick:
    `riemannIntegral_congr_mod` (weaken to a common modulus, move the certificate, transport the
    integrand).
  - Honest scope: one split, at the midpoint of an arbitrary interval. **Iterating it is left to
    the consumer** — no induction over subdivisions is performed here — and nothing about
    non-dyadic split points is claimed. Integration substrate; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **Certified integration, brick 69 — POSITIVE ON A PIECE ⟹ POSITIVE OVERALL** (new
  `Square/IntegralPiece.lean`): the first use of brick 68's splitting law, in the shape every
  downstream consumer wants. For a non-negative Lipschitz integrand each half of `[0,1]` is a
  lower bound for the whole integral (`riemannIntegral_ge_left_half`,
  `riemannIntegral_ge_right_half`), so `Pos` on a half gives `Pos` overall
  (`riemannIntegral_pos_of_left_half`, `riemannIntegral_pos_of_right_half`).
  - Before brick 68 this could not be said at all: every gateway law acted on a fixed interval, so
    a bound established on part of the domain had no route to the whole. With the split it is
    three lines — the other half is non-negative, so it can only help.
  - Honest scope: the **coarsest** scale of the statement — halves, not arbitrary sub-intervals.
    The general form needs the split at an arbitrary `[a, a+w]` (brick 68 composed under the
    affine pullback), which is *not* done here, and this is therefore **not yet** an `L²`
    definiteness statement: that additionally needs a constructive way to locate a point of
    non-vanishing inside a dyadic piece using only rational comparisons.

- **Certified integration, brick 68 — THE INTEGRAL SPLITS AT THE MIDPOINT** (new
  `Square/IntegralSplit.lean`): `∫₀¹ f ≈ ∫₀^{1/2} f + ∫_{1/2}^1 f`
  (`riemannIntegral_split_half`), the one structural law the integral gateway did not have.
  - Every prior law of the gateway — `riemannIntegral_nonneg`, `_le`, `_add`, `_congr`, `_neg`,
    `_smul` and their interval mirrors — acts on a **fixed** interval. Nothing related an integral
    to integrals over its sub-intervals, which is why "positive on a piece ⟹ positive overall"
    had no route, and with it `∫₀¹ φ² ≈ 0 ⟹ φ ≈ 0` (L² definiteness) — the step that would let
    brick 64's determinacy be stated as "is the zero function" rather than "is moment-null".
  - The proof is exact at every finite level: the partition points of the two halves at level `m`
    **interleave** into those of `f` at level `m+1` (`affine_left_point`, `affine_right_point`), so
    `½·D_m(f(x/2)) + ½·D_m(f((1+x)/2)) = D_{m+1}(f)` as a finite identity (`riemannSum_halves`,
    `dyadicR_halves`) with `RsumN_split_at` doing the two-block flattening. Only then is a limit
    taken: three `riemannIntegral_dyadic_dist` reads at a common depth, gap `(D+E)/(k+1)` for every
    `k`, closed both ways by the Archimedean criterion.
  - Two mechanization notes worth keeping: the `Nat` indices sit inside the `Nat.succ_pos` proof
    terms the denominators carry, so they must be moved by `subst`-based index congruences
    (`riemannSum_idx`, `RsumN_idx`), never by `rw`; and `riemannIntegral`'s implicit integrand
    must **not** be left to unification against an inline lambda carrying `by decide` proofs —
    that whnf-explodes, and naming the pullbacks (`halfL`, `halfR`) fixes it.
  - Honest scope: one split, at the midpoint, for the Lipschitz class on `[0,1]`. Composing it
    under the affine pullback gives every dyadic subdivision, but that composition is not performed
    here, and nothing about non-dyadic split points is claimed. Integration substrate only —
    nothing here touches the Weil form; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 67 — THE LEVEL IS AT LEAST THREE-DIMENSIONAL, AND A RETRACTION**
  (new `Square/CoSupportDimThree.lean`): `a·deep3 + b·deep4 + c·deep5` with vanishing `x³`, `x⁴`
  and `x⁵` moments forces `a = b = c = 0` (`deep345_independent`) — the third coefficient brick 55
  left open.
  - The missing entry was the `x⁵` row, the one all three members contribute to
    (`−1/924`, `1/5544`, `−1/72072`), whose assembled identity carries the product denominator
    `924·5544·72072 ≈ 3.7·10¹¹`.
  - **Retraction.** Brick 55's docstring recorded that step as overrunning the elaborator's whnf
    budget and "not worth a workaround". **That record was wrong.** The assembled identity is
    *linear* in the coefficients, so `ring_uor` normalises it in a single pass, and
    `combo345_moment_five` elaborates at the **default** heartbeat budget with no `set_option` at
    all. Nothing conceptual and nothing mechanical was in the way. `CoSupportDimension.lean`'s
    header and `deep34_independent`'s docstring are corrected in this commit to say so.
  - Consequence: co-support level `3` carries three `ℕ`-independent constructed members, so
    brick 58's `ℕ`-parametrized family is genuinely three-parameter.
  - Honest scope: independence over `ℕ` coefficients of three constructed members, read off the
    exact moment table — still not a dimension formula, still nothing about unrealized levels.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 66 — THE MEMBER GENERATOR, AND THE `K = 7` MEMBER IN FIFTEEN
  LINES** (new `Square/PolyMember.lean`): brick 65 turned a polynomial test's moments into an
  explicit rational; this turns that into a *constructor*.
  - **The support law** (`polyPN_supp`): a `ℤ`-coefficient polynomial test is `[0,1]`-supported
    exactly when its two coefficient sums agree. That is the "both parts sum to the same value"
    identity every constructed member has quietly satisfied (`deep6`'s parts both sum to `4279`) —
    now a theorem, because `clamp01` is `1` past `1`, so the value on every half-line window *is*
    the coefficient sum (`polyN_window_val`).
  - **The generator** (`polyPN_hatVanishes`): matching coefficient sums plus `K` matching Hilbert
    contractions produce a certified depth-`K` co-support member. Solve the `ℚ`-linear Hilbert
    system, get a member — no per-degree integration, no hand-built `pv_`/`fv_` chains.
  - **Exercised at once**: `deep7 = x − 36x² + 420x³ − 2310x⁴ + 6930x⁵ − 12012x⁶ + 12012x⁷ −
    6435x⁸ + 1430x⁹` (both parts summing to `20793`), first non-vanishing moment
    `⟨deep7, x⁷⟩ = −1/1750320`. The strict filtration chain reaches `0 ⊋ 1 ⊋ ⋯ ⊋ 8`
    (`cosupport_chain_strict_eight`) and the skeleton's positivity fires on it (`weil_psd_deep7`).
    Every one of those is now a `decide` on rational arithmetic — fifteen lines where brick 60
    needed a two-hundred-line file.
  - Honest scope: a **constructor, not an existence theorem**. It says a *given* solution of the
    rational system yields a member, not that solutions exist at every depth — that is still the
    hypergeometric identity the layer cannot reach; each `deepK` is found by a `ℚ`-linear solve
    outside the kernel and certified inside it. The positivity remains the skeleton's diagonal
    multiplier form on moment data, not the Weil functional on the test space. Step 4 is RH; the
    crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 65 — EVERY POLYNOMIAL TEST'S MOMENT, IN CLOSED FORM** (new
  `Square/PolyMoment.lean`): `⟨Σ_{i<d} a_i xⁱ, xⁿ⟩ = Σ_{i<d} a_i/(i+n+1)`
  (`mellinMoment_polyN`, `mellinMoment_polyPN`) — an explicit **rational**, read straight off
  brick 34's Hilbert matrix.
  - Every constructed member so far (`cubeBump`, the quartic, `deep3 … deep6`, `lin1`, `lin2`) had
    its moments evaluated by a hand-built `pv_add`/`pv_scale` chain, one theorem per degree per
    member. This is the general law those chains were instances of, proved once by induction on
    the coefficient count.
  - Consequence: the polynomial co-support theory is **finite rational linear algebra**. Level `K`
    membership is the `K` rational equations `polyMomQ a n d = polyMomQ b n d`
    (`polyPN_moments_zero_of_rational`), and with brick 64 the case `K = d` already forces the
    *whole* moment sequence to vanish (`polyPN_all_moments_zero_of_rational`). Constructing a
    member at any depth is a `ℚ`-linear solve against the Hilbert matrix — no new integration, no
    new per-degree engine.
  - Cross-checked against an independently hand-computed value: the same coefficient data as
    brick 36's `lin1 = x − 3x² + 2x³`, run through `polyMomQ`, reproduces `⟨lin1,x⁰⟩ = 0` and
    `⟨lin1,x¹⟩ = −1/60` (`polyMoment_lin1_zero`, `polyMoment_lin1_one`).
  - Honest scope: a closed form for the moments. It says nothing about *which* coefficient vectors
    solve the system (existence at general `K` is still the hypergeometric identity the layer
    cannot reach), nothing about the support side, and nothing about the Weil form.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 64 — DETERMINACY ON THE POLYNOMIAL CLASS, AND A DEGREE FLOOR
  FOR CO-SUPPORT MEMBERS** (new `Square/PolyDeterminacy.lean`): the layer's first determinacy
  result, and the structural reason the built members grow in degree with their level.
  - For an integer-coefficient polynomial test with `d` coefficients (`polyPN a b d`, the repo's
    own positive/negative-part idiom): **first `d` moments vanish ⟹ `⟨p,p⟩ ≈ 0` ⟹ every moment
    vanishes** (`innerI_polyPN_self_zero`, `polyPN_all_moments_zero`, `momentL2Sq_polyPN_zero`).
  - Read backwards it is a **degree floor** (`polyPN_degree_floor`, `polyPN_level_null`): a
    polynomial test that is not L²-null cannot sit in co-support level `d` on `d` coefficients, so
    a nonzero level-`K` member needs more than `K` of them. The built members obey it exactly —
    `deep3` is in level 3 and runs to `x⁴`, `deep6` is in level 6 and runs to `x⁸` — and this says
    that growth is **forced**, not an artifact of how the members were solved.
  - No approximation theory is used: expanding `p` in the *first* slot, bilinearity turns `⟨p,p⟩`
    into a `ℕ`-scaled sum of `⟨xⁱ,p⟩ = ⟨p,xⁱ⟩` over `i < d`, each a hypothesis; the scaling
    transfer is brick 43's `pv_scale` at the rational value `0`, so the sealed (`@[irreducible]`)
    `natScale` is never unfolded. The step from zero energy to every moment is brick 63.
  - Honest scope: determinacy for **polynomial** tests only. The general question — a nonzero
    bounded-Lipschitz test with every moment vanishing — is untouched; it needs a constructive
    approximation theorem (Bernstein) the repo does not have. Step 4 is RH; crux fields `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 63 — THE MOMENT GEOMETRY IS AN L² INVARIANT** (new
  `Square/L2MomentBridge.lean`): the compatibility law between the layer's two energies — the
  function-space `⟨φ,φ⟩ = ∫₀¹ φ²` (bricks 9–14) and the `ℓ²` moment energy `‖φ̂‖²` (bricks 40–61).
  - `⟨φ,φ⟩ ≈ 0 ⟹ every moment vanishes ⟹ ‖φ̂‖² ≈ 0`
    (`moments_zero_of_innerI_self_zero`, `momentL2Sq_zero_of_innerI_self_zero`), and the L²-null
    tests are a radical — they pair to zero with everything (`innerI_zero_of_innerI_self_zero`),
    the L² mirror of brick 61's `crossMomL2_zero_of_null`.
  - `d²(φ,ψ) ≈ 0` transfers the moments (`mellinMoment_congr_of_dist2I`), hence the `ℓ²` energy
    (`momentL2Sq_congr_of_dist2I`, through brick 47) and the co-support depth
    (`moments_vanish_congr_of_dist2I`): the whole moment geometry **descends to the L² quotient**,
    which is the compatibility the completion axis needs — brick 62's extended pairing is indexed
    by L²-Cauchy sequences while bricks 40–61 live on moment sequences.
  - Nothing new is constructed: brick 9's integral Cauchy–Schwarz supplies
    `⟨φ,xⁿ⟩² ≤ ⟨φ,φ⟩·⟨xⁿ,xⁿ⟩`, fed through brick 61's square-root-free vanishing step.
  - Capstone `innerI_deep3_self_not_zero`: brick 45's certified nonzero *moment* energy (from the
    exact rational third moment `−1/2520`) turns into a certified nonzero *L²* energy — a fact
    about an integral, proved entirely on the moment side.
  - Honest scope: the containment runs **one way only** (L²-null ⊆ moment-null). The converse is
    the determinacy question and is untouched. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 62 — THE UNIFORM L² COMPLETENESS CRITERION** (new
  `Square/L2Complete.lean`): brick 14 built the extended L² pairing `pairingILim` along a sequence
  of tests, but behind a hypothesis mentioning the *second slot* (`d²(Φⱼ,Φₖ)·⟨ψ,ψ⟩` small), so it
  had to be re-verified per `ψ` and was never instantiated. This removes that.
  - **`L2CauchyU Φ := ∀ j k, d²(Φⱼ,Φₖ) ≤ (1/(j+1) + 1/(k+1))²`** — a condition on the sequence
    ALONE — yields the extended pairing `pairingIU Φ ψ` against **every** test, at rate `2/(j+1)`.
  - The bridge is bricks 40/43's move: an index rescale turns a rate into a Bishop modulus. Each
    test carries a *natural-number* bound on its own energy (`selfBnd`, `innerI_self_le_selfBnd`,
    read off brick 10's uniform pairing bound); reading `Φ` along `j ↦ selfBnd ψ·(j+1)` divides the
    modulus by `S`, hence the squared modulus by `S²`, and one factor of `S` is exactly what the
    energy costs (`dist2I_scaled_le`). The estimate is a rational *identity*
    (`1/(S(j+1)) + 1/(S(k+1)) = (1/S)·(1/(j+1) + 1/(k+1))`) plus `S ≤ S²` — no approximation.
  - **The payoff**: the co-support levels are closed under L² limits *of functions*
    (`pairingIU_zero_of_moments`, `pairingIU_cosupport_closed`) — bricks 48 and 57 closed the
    co-support under the test algebra and under completion of coefficient vectors; this closes it
    in the function-space topology the genuine Sonine condition lives in.
  - Non-vacuity and faithfulness: `dist2I_self`, `L2CauchyU_const`, `pairingIU_const` (on a
    constant sequence the extended pairing is the pairing).
  - Honest scope: this constructs the extended pairing **values** on the completion, not a limit
    *function* — no completed L² space of functions, no limit member, no inversion. Nothing touches
    the Weil form; step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 61 — POLARIZATION AND THE NULL SPACE** (new
  `Square/MomentDefinite.lean`): the two laws that upgrade bricks 49–59's positive-semi-definite
  pairing to an inner product with a *characterized* kernel.
  - **The polarization identity** (`momentL2Sq_polarization`):
    `4·⟪φ,ψ⟫ ≈ ‖(φ+ψ)^‖² − ‖(φ−ψ)^‖²`, stated multiplication-free (`(X+X)+(X+X)`), since the
    substrate carries no scalar action on `Real`. Brick 59 expanded the energy by the pairing;
    this inverts it, so the two constructions are one quadratic functional and the pairing carries
    no information its own diagonal does not. `crossMomL2_congr_of_energies` reads it as rigidity.
  - **The null-space characterization** (`momentL2Sq_zero_iff`): `‖φ̂‖² ≈ 0` iff every moment
    `⟨φ, xⁿ⟩` vanishes. Brick 42 gave one direction; the converse is new and turns on a
    **square-root-free "no nilpotents" step** (`Req_zero_of_sq_zero`): `Rle_of_Rsq_le` reflects the
    order through squaring on the non-negatives, so `|x|·|x| ≈ 0 ≈ 0·0` forces `|x| ≤ 0` outright
    — no root is ever extracted.
  - **The null space is a radical** (`crossMomL2_zero_of_null`): via Cauchy–Schwarz (brick 51) and
    the same vanishing step, a null test pairs to zero against *every* `ψ`, so the form descends to
    a definite inner product on the quotient.
  - Realized: `deep3_not_null` / `deep3_moment_not_all_zero` — the constructed `K = 3` member is
    outside the null space, by brick 45's certified positive energy.
  - Honest scope: this *characterizes* the null space as the moment-null tests; it does **not**
    show that space is trivial. Whether a nonzero bounded-Lipschitz test on `[0,1]` can have every
    moment vanish is the determinacy question, untouched. Nothing here touches the Weil form; step
    4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 60 — THE `K = 6` CO-SUPPORT MEMBER** (new
  `Square/DeepMemberSix.lean`):
  `deep6 = x − 28x² + 252x³ − 1050x⁴ + 2310x⁵ − 2772x⁶ + 1716x⁷ − 429x⁸`, the solution of the
  depth-6 moment system over brick 34's Gram form (coefficients summing `4279 − 4279 = 0`). Six
  vanishing moments, then the first non-vanishing one read off the same matrix with no new
  integration — `⟨deep6, x⁶⟩ = 95311/280 − 2190451/6435 = 1/360360` — so `deep6 ∉ HatVanishes · 7`
  (`cosupport_strict_at_six`), and with bricks 37, 41 and 54 the chain reads
  **`0 ⊋ 1 ⊋ 2 ⊋ 3 ⊋ 4 ⊋ 5 ⊋ 6 ⊋ 7`** (`cosupport_chain_strict_seven`). `weil_psd_deep6` fires the
  skeleton's unconditional positivity on a test whose transform vanishes at six integer points.
  HONEST SCOPE: one more member and one more strict level — NOT a proof that every level is
  inhabited or strict. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 59 — THE MOMENT ENERGY IS A QUADRATIC FORM, AND THE PAIRING IS
  ITS POLAR FORM** (new `Square/MomentQuadratic.lean`):
  **`‖(φ+ψ)^‖² ≈ (‖φ̂‖² + ⟪φ,ψ⟫) + (⟪φ,ψ⟫ + ‖ψ̂‖²)`** (`momentL2Sq_add`), the sign-flipped
  companion (`momentL2Sq_sub`), and **the parallelogram law**
  `‖(φ+ψ)^‖² + ‖(φ−ψ)^‖² ≈ (‖φ̂‖² + ‖ψ̂‖²) + (‖φ̂‖² + ‖ψ̂‖²)` (`momentL2Sq_parallelogram`). So the
  `ℓ²` energy of bricks 40–47 and the bilinear pairing of bricks 49–52, 56 are two faces of ONE
  object: the energy is the pairing's diagonal (brick 49) and expands by the pairing (here) —
  exactly the structure a positivity argument acts on, rather than two separately-constructed
  limits. No new limit: everything is derived from the diagonal identity, symmetry and
  left-additivity, with symmetry supplying the right-slot laws (`crossMomL2_add_right`,
  `crossMomL2_neg_right`, `momentL2Sq_neg`). The parallelogram's four cross terms `+X,+X,−X,−X`
  cancel through the `RsumL` additive normalizer — `ring_uor` is `Int`/`Q`-only and the pointwise
  route would clear denominators multiplicatively — and the cancellation needs NO permutation:
  `RsumL_cancel_anywhere` splits the list in place, twice. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay
  `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 58 — THE POSITIVITY FIRES ON AN INFINITE FAMILY OF NONZERO
  CO-SUPPORT MEMBERS** (new `Square/CoSupportFamily.lean`): bricks 29 and 48 fired the skeleton's
  unconditional positivity at single constructed members; brick 57 made the levels linear
  subspaces; this draws the consequence at the whole realized family. For every `a, b, c : ℕ` the
  combination `combo345 a b c` lies in level `3`, so **`combo345_weil_psd`** and — at the
  truncation-uniform *completed* `ℓ²` member — **`combo345_weil_psd_completed`** hold at every
  truncation. The family is non-vacuous *uniformly*: whenever `a ≥ 1` the member carries strictly
  positive moment energy (**`combo345_energy_pos`**), because brick 55's table reads the third
  moment off the first coefficient exactly (`⟨combo345 a b c, x³⟩ = −a/2520`, squaring to
  `a²/6350400`) and brick 45 turns a nonzero moment into `Pos` energy. So the positivity fires on
  infinitely many genuinely nonzero members, indexed faithfully by `a`, not on a family that
  might collapse to the zero sequence. HONEST SCOPE: still the discrete diagonal-multiplier form
  on moment data, now over a realized infinite family rather than single instances — NOT the Weil
  functional on the test space, NOT positivity beyond the complement. Step 4 is RH; the crux
  fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 57 — THE CO-SUPPORT LEVELS ARE GENUINE LINEAR SUBSPACES** (new
  `Square/CoSupportSubspace.lean`): brick 22 gave closure under `+` at a shared decay constant;
  on compact support the rest follows cleanly, because there the predicate *is* moment-vanishing
  and the moment map is linear — **`hatVanishes_neg`, `hatVanishes_sub`, `hatVanishes_natScale`**
  (plus the compact restatement `hatVanishes_add_supp`), with the support side closed alongside
  (`unitSupported_neg`/`_add`/`_sub`). The payoff is **`combo345_in_level_three`**: EVERY
  natural-coefficient combination `a·deep3 + b·deep4 + c·deep5` lies in level `3`. Read with
  brick 55 — those three are independent as far as the moment functionals at `3,4,5` see them —
  each realized level carries an infinite, genuinely multi-dimensional family rather than one
  witness and its multiples. This matters for the route because step 4's coupling would have to
  act on a *space*. HONEST SCOPE: closure under the linear operations on the compact-support
  branch (decay constant `0`); the general shared-`C` statement remains brick 22's addition only.
  Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 56 — THE PAIRING IS LINEAR, AND HENCE CONTINUOUS IN THE TEST**
  (new `Square/MomentPairingNeg.lean`): brick 52 gave additivity; this gives the other half of
  linearity and reads off the consequence — **`⟪−φ,ψ⟫ ≈ −⟪φ,ψ⟫`** (`crossMomL2_neg_left`),
  **`⟪φ−ψ,χ⟫ ≈ ⟪φ,χ⟫ − ⟪ψ,χ⟫`** (`crossMomL2_sub_left`), and the modulus of continuity
  **`|⟪φ,χ⟫ − ⟪ψ,χ⟫| ≤ 2·M_{φ−ψ}·M_χ`** (`crossMomL2_dist_le`): two tests close in the bound `M`
  of their difference have close pairings against every fixed `χ`. With bricks 49–52 the moment
  pairing is now a symmetric, bilinear, Cauchy–Schwarz-obeying, continuous form. Negation needed
  the same care as addition: `⟪−φ,ψ⟫` and `⟪φ,ψ⟫` are `Rlim`s along *different* rescale schedules
  (`crossScale (−φ) ψ` need not equal `crossScale φ ψ`), so the comparison is again made at a
  COMMON CUT, where `crossMomSum_neg_left` is exact and brick 52's `crossMomSum_dist_limit`
  carries both sides. Subtraction is then free, `L2Test.sub` being `add _ (neg _)` by definition.
  Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 55 — THE CO-SUPPORT LEVELS ARE NOT ONE-DIMENSIONAL** (new
  `Square/CoSupportDimension.lean`): level `HatVanishes · 3` carries a family of at least
  dimension two, so its inhabitation is not the accident of a single witness and its multiples.
  `deep3`, `deep4`, `deep5` all lie in level `3` (`deep345_in_level_three`), and the moment
  functionals at `3, 4, 5` separate them in a TRIANGULAR pattern — every entry read off brick
  34's Hilbert matrix with no new integration (`cosupport_triangular_table`, with the three new
  evaluations `⟨deep3,x⁴⟩ = −1/1260`, `⟨deep3,x⁵⟩ = −1/924`, `⟨deep4,x⁵⟩ = 1/5544`).
  Lower-triangular with nonzero diagonal, so the coefficients come off one at a time:
  **`deep34_independent`** does the first two — the `x³` moment sees only `deep3`, then the `x⁴`
  moment only `deep4`. New reusable pieces: `nat_eq_zero_of_ofQ_zero` and its negated companion,
  which turn a vanishing constructed real `ofQ ⟨a,d⟩ ≈ 0` back into `a = 0` (the substrate has no
  `ofQ` injectivity lemma, so the honest route is to exhibit the `Pos` witness a nonzero `a`
  would supply and collide it with `not_Pos_zero`). HONEST SCOPE: independence over NATURAL
  coefficients, and only for the first TWO of the three members — the third step's rational
  identity carries denominators (`924·5544·72072`) that blow the elaborator's whnf budget, and is
  not worth a workaround for a statement the table already exhibits. Not a dimension formula, not
  a basis, nothing about unconstructed levels. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 54 — THE `K = 5` CO-SUPPORT MEMBER** (new
  `Square/DeepMemberFive.lean`):
  `deep5 = x − 21x² + 140x³ − 420x⁴ + 630x⁵ − 462x⁶ + 132x⁷`, the solution of the depth-5 moment
  system over brick 34's Gram form. Five vanishing moments, then the first non-vanishing one read
  off the same matrix with no new integration — `⟨deep5, x⁵⟩ = 748873/9009 − 665/8 = −1/72072` —
  so `deep5 ∉ HatVanishes · 6` (`cosupport_strict_at_five`) and, with bricks 37 and 41, the chain
  reads **`0 ⊋ 1 ⊋ 2 ⊋ 3 ⊋ 4 ⊋ 5 ⊋ 6`** (`cosupport_chain_strict_six`). The member is apart from
  zero at `deep5(1/10) = −3843/625000` — the first constructed member whose sample value is
  NEGATIVE, so apartness is witnessed on the negation — and `weil_psd_deep5` fires the skeleton's
  unconditional positivity on a nonzero test whose transform vanishes at five integer points.
  HONEST SCOPE: one more member and one more strict level, NOT a proof that every level is
  inhabited or strict. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 53 — DEEP CO-SUPPORT IS NEARLY ORTHOGONAL TO EVERYTHING** (new
  `Square/CoSupportPairing.lean`): brick 42's diagonal rate, generalized to the bilinear pairing —
  **`φ ∈ HatVanishes · K ⟹ |⟪φ, ψ⟫| ≤ 2·M_φ·M_ψ/(K+1)` for EVERY `ψ`**
  (`crossMomL2_abs_le_of_hatVanishes`). Brick 42 said a depth-`K` member carries little moment
  *energy* (`‖φ̂‖² ≤ 2M_φ²/(K+1)`), which is the case `ψ = φ`; this says the same member is nearly
  perpendicular to the whole space, at the same rate, with the bound linear in each test's own
  `M`. So the deep levels of the filtration are not merely thin — they are nearly orthogonal to
  everything the layer can pair them against. The proof is the co-support condition eating the
  head of the series: below `K` the `φ`-moments vanish, so every cross partial sum is *literally*
  a window from the cut `K` (`crossMomSum_zero_below`, `crossMomSum_eq_window`), and brick 49's
  window bound applies uniformly in the window length; the limit inherits from both sides as in
  brick 50. Instance at `deep3` (rate `1/4`). Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 52 — THE MOMENT PAIRING IS BILINEAR** (new
  `Square/MomentPairingBilinear.lean`): the last inner-product law, and the one the substrate
  makes hardest — **`⟪φ + ψ, χ⟫ ≈ ⟪φ, χ⟫ + ⟪ψ, χ⟫`** (`crossMomL2_add_left`). At every *finite*
  truncation the identity is exact (the moment map is additive, so the coefficient vectors add
  and `innerN_add_left` splits the sum); the difficulty is entirely in the limit, since `RReg` is
  not closed under addition here and the three pairings are `Rlim`s along three *different*
  rescale schedules, leaving no common index for a termwise comparison. The fix is to compare at
  a COMMON CUT instead of at the schedules: the window bound gives more than convergence along
  the chosen schedule — *any* cut beyond the `j`-th scheduled one is within `1/(j+1)` of the
  scheduled read (`crossMomSum_dist_scheduled`), hence within `3/(j+1)` of the limit
  (**`crossMomSum_dist_limit`**, the reusable half: the pairing may be read off *any*
  sufficiently deep partial sum, not only the rescaled ones the construction happened to use).
  At the cut `(c₁+c₂+c₃)·(k+1)` all three are within `3/(k+1)` of partial sums satisfying the
  identity exactly, so the gap is `9/(k+1)` for every `k` and the Archimedean criterion closes
  both directions. New reusable piece: `Rabs_sub_triangle`. With brick 50's symmetry it transfers
  to the right slot. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 51 — CAUCHY–SCHWARZ AT THE LIMIT** (new
  `Square/MomentPairingCS.lean`): brick 46's uniform bound on the *finite* cross sums is upgraded
  to the pairing itself — **`⟪φ,ψ⟫² ≤ momentL2Sq φ · momentL2Sq ψ`** (`crossMomL2_sq_le`). With
  bricks 49–50 this completes the sqrt-free inner-product geometry on moment sequences: a
  symmetric bilinear pairing, its diagonal the `ℓ²` energy, obeying Cauchy–Schwarz. Passing a
  *squared* bound through a Bishop limit is the interesting step, since the substrate has no
  square root and `Rlim` does not commute with multiplication; the route avoids both by the
  difference-of-squares identity `x² − X² = (x − X)(x + X)`, which makes the gap a PRODUCT of one
  small factor (`|x − X_k| ≤ 2/(k+1)`, the convergence rate) and one merely bounded factor
  (`|x + X_k| ≤ 2·(2M_φM_ψ)`, brick 50 on both terms). The gap is then `O(1/(k+1))` for every `k`,
  and the Archimedean criterion `Rle_of_Rsub_le_eps` converts that into the bound — no expansion
  of `(X + e)²`, no square root. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 50 — THE MOMENT PAIRING IS SYMMETRIC AND UNIFORMLY BOUNDED**
  (new `Square/MomentPairingLaws.lean`): the two laws that make brick 49's `⟪φ,ψ⟫` behave like
  an inner product rather than an arbitrary limit — **`⟪φ,ψ⟫ ≈ ⟪ψ,φ⟫`** (`crossMomL2_symm`) and
  **`|⟪φ,ψ⟫| ≤ 2·M_φ·M_ψ`** (`crossMomL2_abs_le`). Symmetry is not free: the two limits run
  along *different rescale schedules* (`crossScale φ ψ` and `crossScale ψ φ` agree only up to
  `Nat.mul_comm`), so the sequences are not syntactically the same; `crossScale_comm` aligns the
  cuts and then `innerN_symm` matches them termwise through `Rlim_congr`. The bound is the
  window bound read from cut `0` — every partial cross sum is already within `2M_φM_ψ` of zero —
  inherited by the limit from both sides (`Rlim_le_ofQ` above, `const_le_Rlim` below). On the
  diagonal it recovers brick 40's `momentL2Sq φ ≤ 2M_φ²` from the pairing side
  (`momentL2Sq_le_via_pairing`). Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 49 — THE BILINEAR MOMENT PAIRING CONVERGES** (new
  `Square/MomentPairing.lean`): the off-diagonal companion to the `ℓ²` norm —
  **`⟪φ,ψ⟫ := Σ_n ⟨φ,xⁿ⟩·⟨ψ,xⁿ⟩` now exists as a constructed real** (`crossMomL2`), with the
  diagonal identity **`⟪φ,φ⟫ ≈ momentL2Sq φ`** (`crossMomL2_diag`) and the canonical convergence
  rate (`crossMomL2_approx`). Brick 46 bounded the cross sums uniformly; this shows they actually
  converge, so the moment sequences carry a genuine bilinear pairing and not merely a norm.
  THE SQUARE ROOT IS EXACT, which is what keeps it sqrt-free: the Cauchy modulus needs an
  absolute bound on a window, and Cauchy–Schwarz on the window against brick 39's two tails gives
  `(2M_φ²/(a+1))·(2M_ψ²/(a+1))` — the *exact square of the rational* `2M_φM_ψ/(a+1)`
  (`crossBound`), so `Rle_of_Rsq_le` converts the squared bound to the linear one with no square
  root anywhere (the substrate has none on general reals, and none is needed; the AM-GM route
  `|ab| ≤ ½(a²+b²)` would need a real algebraic expansion, this needs only rational arithmetic).
  The rescale is then LINEAR — the modulus wanted is `1/(j+1)`, not its square — reusing brick
  40's `scale_cross` with `crossScale φ ψ = 2|M_φ.num||M_ψ.num| + 1`. The diagonal identity
  sandwiches two differently-rescaled limits via brick 45 and `term_le_Rlim`. HONEST SCOPE: the
  bilinear `ℓ²` pairing of moment sequences of bounded-Lipschitz tests on `[0,1]` — a pairing on
  moment data, not an inner product on a completed function space, and nothing about the Weil
  form. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 48 — THE SKELETON'S POSITIVITY FIRES ON THE COMPLETED `ℓ²`
  MEMBER** (new `Square/CoSupportCompletion.lean`): the co-support result moves off finite
  moment data and onto the truncation-uniform limit object the completion axis constructs —
  **`Rnonneg (weilQuad (multForm burnolMult) (limMemberU (momIdx φ) _) N)`**
  (`weil_psd_on_completed_cosupport`) for every `[0,1]`-supported test whose transform vanishes
  at `0, 1`, at every truncation. The band hypothesis is discharged, not assumed: the completed
  member's band coordinate *is* the test's first moment (brick 44), which co-support kills
  (`limMemberU_momIdx_band_zero`). WHY IT IS NOT A RESTATEMENT of brick 16's
  `sonine_complement_complete`: that carried positivity through a completion for a
  *fixed-truncation* member of an *abstract* band-vanishing Cauchy family; here the family is
  the moment data of a constructed test, the member is *truncation-uniform*, convergence is
  strong at every truncation (`deep3_momIdx_converges`), and the member is **not the zero
  sequence** — `completed_cosupport_nonzero` records `Pos (momentL2Sq deep3)` from brick 45, so
  the completion-level positivity is not vacuous. Instances at `deep3` and `deep4`. HONEST
  SCOPE: still the discrete diagonal-multiplier form on moment data, now at the completion
  level — NOT the Weil functional on the test space, and NOT positivity beyond the complement.
  Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 47 — THE MOMENT ENERGY IS A MOMENT-INVARIANT** (new
  `Square/MomentInvariant.lean`): **`(∀ n, ⟨φ,xⁿ⟩ ≈ ⟨ψ,xⁿ⟩) ⟹ momentL2Sq φ ≈ momentL2Sq ψ`**
  (`momentL2Sq_congr`) — the well-definedness the `ℓ²` norm needs to be a norm *on the moment
  sequence* rather than an artifact of the construction. The norm was built through an index
  rescale keyed to the test's own bound `M_φ` (`momScale φ`), so a priori two tests with the
  same moments but different `M` read their limits along different schedules; this shows the
  value is the same regardless — the rescale is scaffolding, not content. The proof is brick 45
  used both ways: equal moments give equal partial energies (`momentSqSum_congr`), so each
  rescaled read of one energy equals a partial energy of the other, which brick 45 bounds by its
  total; `Rlim_le_const` gives `≤` and symmetry closes it. Capstone: a second certified nonzero
  energy, `Pos (momentL2Sq bumpU)` off `⟨bumpU, x⁰⟩ = 1/6`. HONEST SCOPE: well-definedness of
  the `ℓ²` moment energy for bounded-Lipschitz tests on `[0,1]`, nothing about the Weil form.
  Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 46 — A UNIFORM CAUCHY–SCHWARZ FOR THE MOMENT SEQUENCES** (new
  `Square/MomentGram.lean`): the cross moment sums are controlled by the two `ℓ²` energies at
  every truncation at once —
  **`(Σ_{n<N} ⟨φ,xⁿ⟩·⟨ψ,xⁿ⟩)² ≤ momentL2Sq φ · momentL2Sq ψ`** (`crossMomSum_sq_le`). The proof
  is the finite Hilbert core meeting brick 45: the moment sequence is literally a coordinate
  vector (`momSeq φ n = ⟨φ,xⁿ⟩`), so the layer's sqrt-free finite Cauchy–Schwarz (`cauchy_schwarz`,
  via the Lagrange identity) applies verbatim, and brick 45's `momentSqSum φ N ≤ momentL2Sq φ`
  lifts each diagonal factor from the partial energy to the total (product monotonicity closing
  it). No new limit is constructed — a uniform bound on finite sums, so the `ℓ²` cross geometry
  is exhibited without a fresh completion. HONEST SCOPE: the `ℓ²` geometry of the moment map on
  bounded-Lipschitz tests, not an inner product on a completed function space, nothing about the
  Weil form. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 45 — THE ENERGY DETECTS THE MOMENTS** (new
  `Square/MomentEnergyDetect.lean`): the "from the limit" companion to brick 42.
  **`⟨φ, xⁿ⟩² ≤ momentL2Sq φ`** for every `n` (`mellinMoment_sq_le_momentL2Sq`), so any moment
  apart from zero forces the energy apart from zero (`momentL2Sq_pos_of_moment`). Brick 42
  bounded the energy from ABOVE by co-support depth; this bounds it from BELOW by every squared
  moment, and together they say the energy sees exactly the moment data. The enabler is
  `momentSqSum φ N ≤ momentL2Sq φ` (`momentSqSum_le_momentL2Sq`) — the `X k ≤ lim X` direction,
  available because the rescaled partial sums are monotone (`term_le_Rlim`); a `≤ Rlim` from a
  fixed term was the one comparison the completion axis lacked (`Rlim_le_ofQ` only bounds the
  limit from above). Capstone: the constructed `K = 3` member `deep3` has third moment `−1/2520`,
  apart from zero, so **`Pos (momentL2Sq deep3)`** — a certified NONZERO moment energy, as a
  genuinely nonzero not-full-co-support test must carry. HONEST SCOPE: a lower bound on the
  `ℓ²` moment energy by individual squared moments — still the compact `[0,1]` moment map,
  nothing about the Weil form. It does NOT settle determinacy (a nonzero test with all moments
  zero would need `momentL2Sq φ = 0 → φ = 0`, a moment-problem uniqueness this does not
  provide). Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 44 — THE COMPLETED MEMBER *IS* THE MOMENT SEQUENCE** (new
  `Square/MomentMember.lean`): the identification brick 43 deliberately declined to claim.
  **`limMemberU (momIdx φ) _ i ≈ ⟨φ, xⁱ⟩`** (`limMemberU_momIdx`), so the object brick 17
  constructs from the `ℓ²` data is `momSeq φ` on the nose — the very sequence the skeleton's
  unconditional positivity consumes (`weil_psd_on_cosupport`) — and strong convergence reads
  directly on it: `d²(momIdx φ j, momSeq φ) ≤ N·(2/(j+1))²` at every truncation
  (`momIdx_converges_to_momSeq`). This is where brick 38's *sharp* decay earns its keep a
  second time: the limit is evaluated at a **uniform** linear rate (`Rlim_eval_real_rate`),
  which needs `|momIdx φ j i − ⟨φ,xⁱ⟩| ≤ C/(j+1)` for EVERY `j`, not merely eventually. Below
  the cut the difference is literally zero; above it the cut condition `c(j+1)² ≤ i` forces
  `j+1 ≤ i` (`cut_index_le`), so `|⟨φ,xⁱ⟩| ≤ M/(i+1)` is already `≤ C/(j+1)` at `C = momScale φ`
  (`momScale_ge_num`, `moment_rate_cross`). A merely bounded moment sequence would leave only
  an eventual bound, which the uniform-rate evaluator cannot use. HONEST SCOPE: the completed
  member of the moment cuts, identified — still the compact `[0,1]` moment map of a
  bounded-Lipschitz test, not the `L²` function-space completion, and nothing about the Weil
  form. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 43 — THE FIRST GENUINE `ℓ²` INSTANCE OF THE
  TRUNCATION-UNIFORM COMPLETION** (new `Square/MomentCompletion.lean`): the moment vector of
  any bounded-Lipschitz test, cut along a **quadratically** rescaled truncation, satisfies the
  completion axis's own interface — **`momIdx_sqCauchyU : SqCauchyU (momIdx φ)`**, i.e.
  `∀ N, d²(momIdx φ j, momIdx φ k) ≤ (1/(j+1) + 1/(k+1))²` with the modulus *independent of the
  truncation `N`*. So brick 17's `limMemberU`/`limMemberU_converges` fires on real `ℓ²` data
  rather than on a hypothesis (`momIdx_completes`): the layer's completion axis and its
  `L²`/moment axis meet. The rescale is the content — brick 39's tail bound is `2M²/(a+1)` at
  cut `a` while the canonical Cauchy modulus is a SQUARE, so brick 40's linear rescale
  `a = c(j+1)` (enough for the norm) is too slow; the truncation-uniform statement needs
  `a = c·(j+1)²`, discharging through the same `scale_cross` step at `k = (j+1)²` (that lemma
  promoted from private to public for the second consumer). The termwise input is that cutting
  a coordinate only removes energy (`momTrunc_diff_sq_le`), so the whole squared distance is a
  TAIL of the squared-moment series at every truncation at once (`dist2_momTrunc_le`). HONEST
  SCOPE: a realized `SqCauchyU` instance from the compact `[0,1]` moment map — the completion
  axis's "genuine `ℓ²` weights" supplied by an actual object, NOT the `L²` function-space
  strong completeness (still open); the identification of the resulting `limMemberU` with the
  moment sequence itself is not claimed. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 42 — DEEP CO-SUPPORT MEANS SMALL MOMENT ENERGY** (new
  `Square/CoSupportEnergy.lean`): the filtration's levels are not just properly nested
  (bricks 36–37, 41), they are quantitatively **thin** —
  **`φ ∈ HatVanishes · K ⟹ ‖φ̂‖² = Σ_n ⟨φ, xⁿ⟩² ≤ 2·M_φ²/(K+1)`**
  (`momentL2Sq_le_of_hatVanishes`), and full co-support (every moment vanishing) gives energy
  exactly zero (`momentL2Sq_zero_of_moments`). The proof is bricks 39–40 doing their job
  together: depth `K` kills the head of the sum outright (`momentSqSum_zero` — the first `K`
  terms are literally zero), so *every* partial sum is a tail, and brick 39's uniform tail
  bound read at `N = K` bounds them all at once (`momentSqSum_le_of_moments`, by cases on
  `N ≤ K` or `N = K + d`); brick 40's `Rlim` then inherits the bound termwise through
  `Rlim_le_ofQ` — no epsilon argument, because the bound is uniform in the index rather than
  approached in the limit. HONEST SCOPE: a rate for the moment energy of a bounded-Lipschitz
  test on `[0,1]` in terms of co-support depth. It bounds nothing about the Weil functional,
  and says nothing about whether a nonzero test with all moments vanishing exists (the
  determinacy question is untouched). Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 41 — THE `K = 4` CO-SUPPORT MEMBER, AND THE STRICT CHAIN
  EXTENDED** (new `Square/DeepMemberFour.lean`):
  `deep4 = x − 15x² + 70x³ − 140x⁴ + 126x⁵ − 42x⁶`, the nonzero rational solution of
  `Σᵢ aᵢ/(i+n+1) = 0` for `n = 0,1,2,3` together with the support condition `Σᵢ aᵢ = 0` —
  a finite linear-algebra problem over brick 34's Gram closed form, not a construction
  problem. Delivered: `deep4_supp` (`197 − 197 = 0`), the four vanishing moments,
  **`deep4_hatVanishes`** (`HatVanishes deep4 4`), the first non-vanishing moment
  `⟨deep4, x⁴⟩ = 1291/60 − 14911/693 = 1/13860` (`deep4_moment_four`, read off the same Gram
  matrix — no new integration), hence `deep4 ∉ HatVanishes · 5` and
  **`cosupport_strict_at_four`**. With brick 37's witnesses this gives
  **`cosupport_chain_strict_five`**: `0 ⊋ 1 ⊋ 2 ⊋ 3 ⊋ 4 ⊋ 5`, every level properly containing
  the next, each by an explicit constructed test. The member is apart from zero
  (`deep4(1/10) = 3609/500000`), so **`weil_psd_deep4`** fires the skeleton's unconditional
  positivity on genuinely nonzero `f, f̂` data whose transform vanishes at four integer points.
  HONEST SCOPE: one more member and one more strict level — NOT a proof that every level is
  inhabited or strict (that needs invertibility of the Hilbert sections in general), and the
  positivity is still the skeleton's diagonal multiplier form on moment data. Step 4 is RH;
  the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 40 — THE `ℓ²` NORM OF THE MOMENT SEQUENCE, AS A CONSTRUCTED
  REAL** (new `Square/MomentNorm.lean`): `‖φ̂‖² := Σ_n ⟨φ, xⁿ⟩²` is now an object
  (`momentL2Sq`, a genuine `Real` — not a supremum, not a hypothesis), with
  `0 ≤ ‖φ̂‖² ≤ 2·M_φ²` (`momentL2Sq_nonneg`, `momentL2Sq_le`) and the partial sums converging
  to it at the canonical rate (`momentL2Sq_approx`). Constructively "monotone and bounded"
  does *not* give a limit — a modulus is required, and brick 39's uniform tail bound is
  exactly one. The construction turns rate into Bishop regularity by **rescaling the index**:
  read the partial sums along `N = c·(j+1)` for any natural `c ≥ 2M_φ²` (`momScale`, here
  `2|M.num|² + 1`, which works because `M.den ≥ 1`), so consecutive reads differ by at most
  `2M²/(c(j+1)+1) ≤ 1/(j+1)` — the `RReg` modulus on the nose (`momentSqIdx_RReg`), and `Rlim`
  applies. Supporting pieces: the reusable substrate split
  `Σ_{i<N+K} = Σ_{i<N} + Σ_{i<K}(N+i)` (`RsumN_split_at`), the monotonicity that comes free
  from the terms being squares (`momentSqSum_mono`), and the Cauchy rate `momentSqSum_diff_le`.
  HONEST SCOPE: the `ℓ²` norm of the *moment* sequence of a bounded-Lipschitz test on `[0,1]`
  — not a norm on a completed function space, not the completion axis's truncation-uniform
  weights, and nothing about the Weil form. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 39 — THE `ℓ²` DATUM, WITH AN EXPLICIT TAIL RATE** (new
  `Square/MomentSummable.lean`): the squared moments are not merely bounded, they are
  **summable**, and the tails are certified small —
  **`Σ_{i<K} ⟨φ, x^{N+i}⟩² ≤ 2·M_φ²/(N+1)` uniformly in `K`** (`momentSqTail_le`), so the
  window sums go to zero at rate `1/(N+1)`; at `N = 0` this is the uniform partial-sum bound
  `Σ_{n<K} ⟨φ, xⁿ⟩² ≤ 2·M_φ²` (`momentSqSum_le`). This is what brick 38's *sharp* decay was
  for: the Cauchy–Schwarz rate `O(1/√n)` has non-summable squares, while the square of the
  comparison rate is dominated by the telescoping term `2/((n+1)(n+2))` — the domination is
  the one rational fact `n+2 ≤ 2(n+1)` (`mellinMoment_sq_le`). The dominating series is then
  summed **exactly**, not estimated: `Σ_{i<K} 2/((N+i+1)(N+i+2)) = 2K/((N+1)(N+K+1))`
  (`teleFrom_eq`), a closed form at every window `(N, K)`, from which the uniform bound is one
  rational comparison (`teleFrom_le`). New reusable piece: `Rsq_le_of_abs_le` (`|m| ≤ B`,
  `B ≥ 0` ⟹ `m² ≤ B²`, routed through `|m·m| = |m|·|m|` so no sign case split). HONEST SCOPE:
  a summability rate for the compact `[0,1]` moment map on the bounded-Lipschitz class — *not*
  the completion axis's truncation-uniform `ℓ²` weights (those are about `innerN`'s discrete
  coordinates), and nothing about the Weil form. Step 4 is RH; the crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 38 — THE SHARP MOMENT DECAY** (new
  `Square/MomentDecay.lean`): **`|⟨φ, xⁿ⟩| ≤ M_φ/(n+1)`** (`mellinMoment_abs_le`) for every
  test of the bounded-Lipschitz class — the first quantitative rate on the moment map, and
  the sharp one (attained in order at `φ = xᵏ`, where `⟨xᵏ,xⁿ⟩ = 1/(k+n+1)`). It matters that
  the route is comparison and not Cauchy–Schwarz: CS through `⟨xⁿ,xⁿ⟩ = 1/(2n+1)` gives only
  `O(1/√n)`, whose squares are *not* summable, whereas `O(1/n)` makes the squared moments
  summable — the `ℓ²` datum the completion axis wants rather than a merely bounded sequence.
  Proof: on `[0,1]` the monomial is nonnegative (`powTest_nonneg`), so `φ(x)·xⁿ ≤ M_φ·xⁿ`
  pointwise; `riemannIntegral_le_unit` integrates it against `riemannIntegral_smul` and brick
  34's `∫₀¹ xⁿ = 1/(n+1)`, at a three-term shared modulus (each summand present so every
  weakening is a `Qle_self_add` — `|M| ≥ 1` is not available). New reusable piece:
  `lip_smul_of` (scalar Lipschitz transfer, `q·f` is `|q|·L_f`-Lipschitz). The lower half is
  free: the upper bound at `L2Test.neg φ`, which carries the SAME `M`, with `innerI_neg_left`
  flipping the sign. Honest scope: a rate on the compact `[0,1]` moment map; not the
  truncation-uniform `ℓ²` weights of the completion axis (those are about the discrete
  coordinates), and nothing about the Weil form; step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 37 — THE STRICT CHAIN THROUGH DEPTH 4** (new
  `Square/CoSupportChain.lean`): the co-support filtration is strictly decreasing at *every*
  level the layer has reached —
  `HatVanishes · 0 ⊋ 1 ⊋ 2 ⊋ 3 ⊋ 4` (**`cosupport_chain_strict`**). Brick 36 witnessed the two
  ends; this brick fills the middle with the two members the Hilbert system supplies:
  **`lin1 = x − 3x² + 2x³`** (moment `0` vanishes as `1 − 1`, moment `1` is
  `11/15 − 3/4 = −1/60`) and **`lin2 = x − 6x² + 10x³ − 5x⁴`** (moments `0, 1` vanish as
  `3 − 3` and `7/3 − 7/3`, moment `2` is `23/12 − 67/35 = 1/420`). Each is unit-supported
  (coefficients sum to zero), apart from zero (`lin1(1/10) = 9/125`, `lin2(1/10) = 99/2000`),
  in its level and provably not the next. Every moment is read straight off
  `⟨xⁱ, xʲ⟩ = 1/(i+j+1)` — no new integration, and both members are assembled in the `P − N`
  linear form brick 35's now-public helpers evaluate mechanically (`sub_ofQ_val` promoted too).
  Honest scope: strictness at the four realized levels, each by an explicit constructed test;
  NOT a proof that every level is strict — that needs the Hilbert sections' invertibility in
  general — and nothing about the Weil form; step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 36 — THE CO-SUPPORT FILTRATION DOES NOT COLLAPSE** (new
  `Square/CoSupportStrict.lean`): the nested subspaces
  `HatVanishes · 0 ⊇ HatVanishes · 1 ⊇ ⋯` are STRICTLY decreasing at the realized levels, each
  strictness witnessed by a constructed test in one level and provably not the next.
  Membership was the earlier bricks' work; strictness needs the first NON-vanishing moment,
  and brick 34's Gram closed form supplies it by arithmetic alone: **`deep3_moment_three`** —
  `(1/5 + 30/7 + 14/9) − (10/6 + 35/8) = 1903/315 − 145/24 = −1/2520 ≠ 0`, hence
  **`deep3_not_hatVanishes_four`** and `cosupport_strict_at_three` (level 3 properly contains
  level 4). At the bottom, `cosupport_strict_at_zero` records brick 25's `bumpU = x(1−x)`
  (`f̂(0) = 1/6 ≠ 0`) in the vacuous level 0 and not level 1. Brick 35's six value-chaining
  helpers (`pv_add`/`pv_neg`/`pv_scale`, `fv_add`/`fv_neg`/`fv_scale`) are promoted to public
  — they are the reusable half. Why it matters: a condition that collapsed past some depth
  would make the genuine `f, f̂` space finite-dimensional in the relevant direction, and the
  coupling step 4 needs could not be an infinite-dimensional phenomenon; strictness at the
  realized depths is the finite shadow of that non-collapse — evidence, stated as exactly
  that. Honest scope: two witnessed levels (`0 ⊋ 1`, `3 ⊋ 4`), NOT a proof that every level
  is strict, and nothing about the Weil form; step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 35 — THE `K = 3` CO-SUPPORT MEMBER, READ OFF THE HILBERT
  MATRIX** (new `Square/DeepMemberThree.lean`): with brick 34's Gram closed form, a member at
  depth `K` is no longer a construction problem but a rational linear system —
  `Σᵢ aᵢ/(i+n+1) = 0` for `n < K` plus `Σᵢ aᵢ = 0` — solved at `K = 3` by
  `a = (1, −10, 30, −35, 14)`: **`deep3 = x − 10x² + 30x³ − 35x⁴ + 14x⁵`**. The reusable half
  is **`natScale k φ`** (the `k`-fold sum) with its three transfer laws — support, pointwise
  values, pairing values (`innerI_natScale_val`, on `innerI_zeroL2`) — so integer-coefficient
  combinations are assembled and evaluated without hand-built addition trees. Delivered:
  `deep3_supp` (`45 − 45 = 0` at every window point), `deep3_moment_zero/_one/_two` (each a
  `decide`-able rational identity over the Hilbert entries), **`deep3_hatVanishes`**,
  `deep3_value_tenth` (`p(1/10) = 333/12500`) with `deep3_apart`, and **`weil_psd_deep3`** —
  the skeleton's unconditional positivity on a member whose transform vanishes at THREE
  integer points. Mechanization note: the member is built as `P − N` through
  `L2Test.sub`/`innerI_sub_left`, NOT as a `neg`-wrapped summand — a `L2Test.neg` at the head
  of a deep test tree sends `innerI` unification into a whnf blowup that survives 2M
  heartbeats (bisected; the same chain with the `neg` removed elaborates instantly). Honest
  scope: one member at `K = 3`; the positivity is still the skeleton's diagonal multiplier
  form on moment data, not the Weil functional, and not positivity beyond the complement
  (step 4, = RH). The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 34 — THE HILBERT MATRIX IS THE GRAM MATRIX OF THE MONOMIAL
  BAND** (new `Square/HilbertGram.lean`): **`⟨xⁱ, xʲ⟩ = 1/(i+j+1)`**
  (`innerI_powTest_hilbert`) — the band the co-support condition is orthogonality *to*
  (brick 28's weld) now has its Gram matrix in closed form at every entry. Two ingredients:
  `powTest_mul` (the monomial tests multiply, `xⁱ·xʲ = x^{i+j}` pointwise by induction through
  `Rmul_assoc`, so the pairing's integrand IS a single monomial) and
  `riemannIntegral_powTest_all` (`∫₀¹ clamp01ᵐ = 1/(m+1)` for EVERY `m`, brick 33's law plus
  the constant case), reached at the pairing's own modulus by transport and certificate
  independence. Corollaries: `hilbertGram_symm`, `mellinMoment_powTest`, and
  **`mellinMoment_clamp_via_hilbert`** — brick 33's Hausdorff law recovered as the `i = 1`
  row, so the moment law is the Hilbert matrix's first row. Honest scope: the Gram matrix
  only — no positive-definiteness, no inverse, no conditioning, and nothing about the Weil
  form; positivity on the band's orthogonal complement is step 4 and is RH. The crux fields
  stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 33 — THE HAUSDORFF MOMENT LAW** (new
  `Square/MomentLaw.lean`): **`mellinMoment clampTest n ≈ 1/(n+2)` for EVERY `n`** — one
  theorem subsuming the five per-degree engines; the clamp's moment sequence is the full
  Hausdorff moment data of Lebesgue measure on `[0,1]`. No Faulhaber folds: the engine is the
  discrete mean-value bracket `(m+1)·iᵐ ≤ (i+1)^(m+1) − i^(m+1) ≤ (m+1)·(i+1)ᵐ`
  (`pow_succ_lower`/`_upper`, by induction with the Nat identities discharged through `Int`
  ring normalization), which telescopes to `(m+1)·Σiᵐ ≤ N^(m+1) ≤ (m+1)·(Σiᵐ + Nᵐ)`
  (`powSum_lower`/`_upper`), so the left Riemann sums sit within `1/(N+1)` of `1/(m+1)`
  UNIFORMLY in the degree (`powSum_defect_le`), and `Rlim_eval` closes every degree by the
  same rate (`riemannIntegral_powTest_succ`: `∫₀¹ clamp01^(k+1) ≈ 1/(k+2)`). Mechanization:
  the cast-dedup gotcha bites hard at symbolic exponents — `push_cast` expands
  `↑((N+1)^m) → (↑(N+1))^m`, so pow-cast atoms must be `generalize`d to plain Nat variables
  *before* `push_cast`, and the numerator bound is proved as a single all-Nat inequality cast
  once at the end (`omega` for the Nat-subtraction cast, `Int.natCast_mul`/`Int.natAbs_ofNat`
  for the rest). Honest scope: all integer moments; the continuous Mellin parameter,
  transform pair, and inversion remain open; no coupling; step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay
  `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 32 — THE NONZERO `K = 2` CO-SUPPORT MEMBER** (new
  `Square/DeepMember.lean`): **`deepBump = x(1−x)(1−5x+5x²)`**, realized in EXPANDED linear
  form `c − 6c² + 10c³ − 5c⁴` from the test algebra, so the moments split by the pairing's
  BILINEARITY (`innerI_add_left`/`innerI_neg_left` through the `pair_add` split-and-collapse
  helper) into the certified engine values of bricks 23–31, which cancel exactly:
  `∫p = 1/2 − 2 + 5/2 − 1 = 0` and `∫xp = 1/3 − 3/2 + 2 − 5/6 = 0` — no product expansion,
  no shared-modulus juggling. Unit support from `p(1) = 0` (the saturated clamp collapses the
  coefficient tree to `(1+10) − (6+5) = 0`); apartness at `x = 1/10` (`p(1/10) = 99/2000`,
  `Pos`); **`deepBump_hatVanishes`** places it in `HatVanishes · 2`; and the capstone
  **`weil_psd_nonzero_instance`**: the skeleton's unconditional complement-positivity
  (`weil_psd_on_cosupport`, brick 29) fires on the moment sequence of a certified NONZERO
  test whose CONSTRUCTED transform vanishes on the band — genuinely nonzero `f, f̂` data in
  the Sonine complement, no RH. Honest scope: one member at `K = 2`; the positivity remains
  the skeleton's diagonal multiplier form on moment data — not the Weil functional on the
  test space, and not positivity beyond the complement (step 4, = RH). The crux fields stay
  `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 31 — THE QUINTIC EVALUATION** (new
  `Square/MomentQuintic.lean`): **`∫₀¹ clamp01(x)⁵ dx ≈ 1/6`** — the engine at degree five:
  `sumQuinticsQ` (`Σ i⁵ = k²(k−1)²(2k²−2k−1)/12`), `riemannSum_clampQuint`
  (`= N²(2N²+2N−1)/(12(N+1)⁴)`), `genSum_clampQuint_eval` + `quint_defect_le` (the `N⁴`
  terms again cancel; numerator `−(36N³+78N²+48N+12) ≤ 72(N+1)³` coefficientwise), the
  schedule-uniform rate, `riemannIntegral_clampQuint_gen`, and
  `mellinMoment_clamp_four ≈ 1/6`. The clamp's moment data reads
  `(1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, …)`; with brick 30 both engines the nonzero `K = 2` co-support
  member `x(1−x)(1−5x+5x²)` consumes are delivered. Honest scope: degree `n = 4`; the
  general law remains open; no coupling; step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 30 — THE QUARTIC EVALUATION** (new
  `Square/MomentQuartic.lean`): **`∫₀¹ clamp01(x)⁴ dx ≈ 1/5`** — the engine at degree four:
  `sumQuarticsQ` (Faulhaber, `Σ i⁴ = k(k−1)(2k−1)(3k²−3k−1)/30`), `riemannSum_clampQuad`
  (`= N(2N+1)(3N²+3N−1)/(30(N+1)⁴)`), `genSum_clampQuad_eval` + `quad_defect_le` (the `N⁴`
  terms cancel; the numerator collapses to `−(75N³+175N²+125N+30)` and the coefficientwise
  bound `≤ 150(N+1)³` closes it, nonlinear monomials as `omega` atoms over explicit
  nonnegativity facts), the schedule-uniform rate, `riemannIntegral_clampQuad_gen` by
  `Rlim_eval`, and `mellinMoment_clamp_three ≈ 1/5`. The clamp's moment data reads
  `(1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, …)`; first of the two engines (with the quintic) that the nonzero
  `K = 2` co-support member `x(1−x)(1−5x+5x²)` consumes. Honest scope: degree `n = 3`; the
  general law remains open; no coupling; step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 29 — THE BAND BRIDGE** (new `Square/BandBridge.lean`): the
  moment map `momSeq φ = (mellinMoment φ n)ₙ` carries `f, f̂` data into the discrete
  skeleton, relating the two bands: `momSeq_fourier` (`⟨momSeq φ, δₖ⟩_N ≈ ⟨φ, xᵏ⟩` — the
  indicator directions correspond to the monomial directions along the moment map),
  `momSeq_band_vanishes` (the co-support condition pushes forward to the skeleton's band
  condition), `momSeq_bandProj_fixed` (a `K = 2` co-support test's moment sequence is FIXED
  by the skeleton's `bandProj` — it already lives in the Sonine complement), and the
  capstone **`weil_psd_on_cosupport`**: for a `[0,1]`-supported test with `HatVanishes φ 2`,
  the discrete Weil multiplier form is nonnegative on its moment sequence at every
  truncation — `burnol_pairing_psd_on_sonine`'s band hypothesis discharged by the
  CONSTRUCTED transform's vanishing, not assumed of an abstract coefficient family. The
  skeleton's unconditional positivity realized on genuine `f, f̂` data; no RH. Honest scope:
  the bridge runs through the moment map at the Burnol skeleton's single-index band; the
  positivity is the skeleton's diagonal form on moment data, not the Weil functional on the
  test space, and not positivity beyond the complement (step 4, = RH); the `K = 2` instance
  is inhabited by the zero member only — a nonzero `K = 2` member needs the quartic engine
  (banked). The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 28 — THE WELD** (new `Square/CoSupportWeld.lean`): the
  transform-side co-support condition IS an orthogonality condition —
  **`hatVanishes_iff_orthogonal`**: for `[0,1]`-supported tests,
  `HatVanishes φ K ⟺ ⟨φ, xⁿ⟩ ≈ 0 for all n < K`. The `f, f̂` pair is bundled (`MellinPair`,
  a test with its all-order decay data; `MellinPair.hat` its transform;
  `MellinPair.hat_compact` the pair-level `f̂(n) ≈ ⟨φ, xⁿ⟩`), the condition extends over the
  band's span by bilinearity (`orthogonal_band_add`), and the realized instance is genuine:
  `cubePair_orthogonal` — the certified NONZERO cubic bump is orthogonal to the `K = 1`
  monomial band with its transform vanishing there. The function-space mirror of the
  skeleton's `c(i) = 0` band condition, now about constructed `f` and constructed `f̂`.
  Honest scope: the band is the MONOMIAL band, not yet the skeleton's indicator band (that
  relation is the remaining welding step toward `bandProj`); no continuous parameter, no
  inversion; positivity on the orthogonal complement is step 4 and is RH. The crux fields
  stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 27 — THE NONZERO CO-SUPPORT SUBSPACE MEMBER** (new
  `Square/CubicMember.lean`): a genuine nonzero `[0,1]`-supported test INSIDE
  `HatVanishes · 1`. The member is the cubic bump `cubeBump = bumpU·(1−2·clamp)`
  (`x(1−x)(1−2x)`), realized by the test-algebra combinators alone: `cubeBump_supp` (the
  `bumpU` factor kills every window point), **`mellinMoment_cubeBump`** — the zeroth moment
  vanishes EXACTLY (`(1/2 − 1/3) − (2/3 − 1/2) = 0`: the integrand expands pointwise to the
  certified test tree `(c − c²) − ((c² + c²) − (c³ + c³))`, chosen to match the derivation so
  no seq-level add/neg reshuffle — which the reindexing Bishop `Radd` does not admit — is
  needed; the three engine values cancel at one shared modulus through
  `riemannIntegral_add`/`_neg`), **`cubeBump_hatVanishes`** (membership via the brick-22
  moment bridge), and **`cubeBump_value_quarter`/`cubeBump_apart`** (`f(1/4) ≈ 3/32`, `Pos`).
  With brick 25 the co-support geometry is complete on constructed objects: the vanishing
  subspace is PROPER (`bumpU` outside) and INHABITED BEYOND ZERO (`cubeBump` inside, apart
  from zero). Mechanization note: the whnf-timeout gotcha struck again and was resolved
  structurally, not by heartbeats — den-proof terms must match the component rational's shape
  (`add_den_pos` forces an `add`-shaped metavariable; use `by decide` for `neg`-shaped
  components). Honest scope: one member at `K = 1`; deeper `K` needs higher-degree
  evaluations; no coupling — positivity on the co-support class is step 4 and is RH. The crux
  fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 26 — THE CUBIC EVALUATION** (new `Square/MomentCube.lean`):
  **`∫₀¹ clamp01(x)³ dx ≈ 1/4`** — the evaluation engine mirrored one more degree up:
  `sumCubesQ` (Nicomachus, `Σ i³ = (k(k−1)/2)²`), `riemannSum_clampCube`
  (`= N²/(4(N+1)²)` at the inert samples), `genSum_clampCube_eval` + `cube_defect_le` (the
  numerator collapses to `−(8N+4)`), the schedule-uniform rate, and
  `riemannIntegral_clampCube_gen` by `Rlim_eval`; payoff `mellinMoment clampTest 2 ≈ 1/4`.
  The clamp's moment data now reads `(1/2, 1/3, 1/4, …)` — three values of the Hausdorff
  sequence, and the last evaluation the nonzero co-support member (`x(1−x)(1−2x)`, zeroth
  moment `1/2 − 1 + 1/2 = 0`) consumes. Honest scope: the general `1/(n+2)` law remains open;
  no coupling; step 4 is RH. The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 25 — THE FIRST NONZERO TRANSFORM VALUE** (new
  `Square/CoSupportMember.lean`): a genuine `[0,1]`-supported test with **`f̂(0) ≈ 1/6 > 0`**,
  and the co-support subspace is PROPER. The member is the unit bump `bumpU = clamp·(1−clamp)`
  (`x(1−x)` on `[0,1]`), realized by the test-algebra combinators alone. New substrate:
  `qCapQ_eq_of_ge` (the band clamp's missing saturation side) → `clamp01_sat`
  (`clamp01 x ≈ 1` for `x ≥ 1`) → with the affine window's lower bound
  (`affine_window_ge_one`), `bumpU_supp` — the first NONZERO member of the compact class.
  `mellinMoment_bumpU` evaluates `∫₀¹ x(1−x) = 1/6` (pointwise collapse to `clamp − clamp²`,
  certificate transport to the shared modulus, integral additivity, bricks 23–24's values
  `1/2 − 1/3`); `mellinHat_bumpU_value`/`mellinHat_bumpU_pos` carry it through
  `mellinHat_compact` to the transform — the first strict positivity (`Pos`) of the
  constructed `f̂`; and `bumpU_not_hatVanishes` shows `bumpU ∉ HatVanishes · 1`, so with brick
  22's zero member the vanishing subspace is both inhabited and strict: the co-support
  condition genuinely cuts. Honest scope: the nonzero member OF the subspace (the cubic bump
  `x(1−x)(1−2x)`, needing `∫x³ = 1/4`) is banked next; no coupling; step 4 is RH. The crux
  fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 24 — THE FIRST QUADRATIC EVALUATION OF THE GATEWAY** (new
  `Square/MomentSquare.lean`): **`∫₀¹ clamp01(x)² dx ≈ 1/3`** — the identity engine of
  `IntegralEval.lean` mirrored one polynomial degree up on the globally-Lipschitz *clamped*
  square (the bare `x²` is not admissible): the `ℚ`-level square fold (`sumSquaresQ`,
  `Σ i² = k(k−1)(2k−1)/6`), the exact Riemann sums (`riemannSum_clampSq`, clamp inert at the
  dyadic samples), the telescoped evaluation and rational defect (`genSum_clampSq_eval`,
  `sq_defect_le` — the numerator collapses to `−(9N+6)` at the symbolic level via the
  `natAbs` bridge), the schedule-uniform rate, and `riemannIntegral_clampSq_gen` by
  `Rlim_eval`. Payoff: **`mellinMoment clampTest 1 ≈ 1/3`** — the pairing integrand
  `clamp·(1·clamp)` collapses globally to the clamped square at the pairing's own modulus by
  transport. The clamp's moment data now reads `(1/2, 1/3, …)`: the Hausdorff moment sequence
  of Lebesgue measure on `[0,1]`, value by value in the kernel. Honest scope: degree `n = 1`;
  the general `1/(n+2)` law and any transform value remain open. The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 23 — THE MOMENT MAP TAKES CERTIFIED NONZERO VALUES** (new
  `Square/MomentValue.lean`; `Analysis/IntegralLocal.lean` gains the unit-local congruence):
  **`riemannIntegral_congr_unit`** — `∫₀¹ f ≈ ∫₀¹ g` from agreement on `[0,1]` only
  (antisymmetry of `riemannIntegral_le_unit`), the lemma every clamped-integrand evaluation
  runs through; `clamp01_inert` (the band identity at real arguments); and the first nonzero
  values of the transform-side data: `mellinMoment oneTest 0 ≈ 1` (constant integral through
  the global congruence) and **`mellinMoment clampTest 0 ≈ 1/2`** (clamp inert on the sampling
  domain → unit-local congruence to the identity integrand at the shared modulus `L = 1` →
  `riemannIntegral_id_gen`). With brick 22's `mellinMoment_zeroL2 ≈ 0` the moment functionals
  provably separate tests. Honest scope: compact `[0,1]` moment values, NOT transform values
  (`clampTest` has no half-line decay); the first nonzero full-transform value is the banked
  next construction. The crux fields stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 22 — THE CO-SUPPORT PREDICATE** (new
  `Square/HatVanishes.lean`): the transform-side vanishing condition is now a stated,
  subspace-shaped, inhabited predicate about constructed transforms. The decay data is
  bundled — `WindowDecay` (the exponent-`(n+2)` bound `mellinHat` consumes) and `AllDecay`
  (every order at one constant, the superpolynomial-decay class) — with the two laws that
  make shared constants reachable: weakening in `C` (`windowDecay_weaken`/`allDecay_weaken`
  via `qmul_le_right_mono`) and addition at the summed constant (`windowDecay_add`/
  `allDecay_add`, triangle against the distributed bound). On that class **`HatVanishes φ K`**
  (`f̂(n) ≈ 0` for `n < K`) with: `hatVanishes_mono` (downward filtration),
  **`hatVanishes_add`** — THE SUBSPACE THEOREM (brick 21's `mellinHat_add` against
  `0 + 0 ≈ 0`), and `hatVanishes_of_moments` — the compact bridge welding the predicate to
  the brick-10 moment skeleton through `mellinHat_compact`. Nonvacuity: the constructed zero
  test `zeroL2`, all moments evaluated to `0` (`mellinMoment_zeroL2`, integrand pointwise
  `≈ 0` → congruence to the constant integrand → `riemannIntegral_const_gen`), and
  `hatVanishes_zeroL2` placing it in the class at every `K`. Honest scope: integer points
  only, no band-indexed vanishing set tied to `bandProj`, no NONZERO member yet (banked
  next), no coupling — positivity on a co-support class is step 4 and is RH. The crux fields
  stay `none`.

- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 21 — THE TRANSFORM IS LINEAR** (new
  `Square/MellinLinear.lean`): **`mellinHat_add`** — `(φ+ψ)^(n) ≈ φ̂(n) + ψ̂(n)` at a shared
  decay constant (the shared-modulus design of `riemannIntegral_add`): the compact piece by
  brick 7's pairing additivity at the monomial test, the tail by `twTail_add` (window sums
  add termwise via `twTerm_add` — the `innerI_add_left` pattern at the interval level through
  the new `riemannIntegralI_certif_irrel` — and the Bishop limits combine by
  `Rlim_add_of_approx` on the SAME schedule). With linearity the transform-side vanishing
  conditions cut out SUBSPACES of the test class — the shape the co-support coupling
  consumes. Plus `Qle_self_add_l` made public (brick 7). Honest scope: additivity only — no
  scalar action, no continuous parameter, no coupling; crux fields `none`.
- **`mellinHat_compact` — the transform of a compactly supported test IS its moment
  sequence** (in `Square/MellinHat.lean`): if `φ` vanishes on `[1,∞)` (at every window
  point), the twisted tail vanishes term by term (each `twTerm ≈ 0` by the window bound at
  `B = 0` and `Rle_antisymm`, the `genSum`s collapse, `Rlim_zero` kills the tail) and
  `f̂(n) ≈ mellinMoment φ n` — the first EVALUATION of the constructed transform, welding
  the compact (brick 10) and half-line (bricks 18–20) Mellin objects into one; with
  `hdec_of_supp` (vanishing satisfies the decay hypothesis at `C = 0`). Crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 20 — THE MELLIN TRANSFORM AT INTEGER POINTS** (new
  `Square/MellinHat.lean`): **`mellinHat φ n = mellinMoment φ n + twTail φ n` — the first
  constructed value of the `f ↦ f̂` direction**, `f̂(n) = ∫₀^∞ φ(t)·tⁿ dt` as a certified
  real for every test with exponent-`(n+2)` window decay. The twisted integrand is built per
  window from the algebra (`φ · powWinTest m n`, brick 19 — equal to `φ·tⁿ` on the window by
  inertness); `tw_collapse` — the exponent-generic estimate
  `C·(m+2)ⁿ/(m+1)^{n+2} ≤ (C·2ⁿ)/((m+1)m)` from the Nat core
  `(m+2)ⁿ(m+1)m ≤ 2ⁿ(m+1)^{n+2}`, power atoms generalized before the ring normalizer;
  `twTerm_bound` — the twisted window integrals obey the gateway's `K/((m+1)m)` shape at
  `K := C·2ⁿ` (brick 18's window bound, `powWinTest_M_le` feeding the power factor);
  **`twTail`** — the twisted half-line tail as a Bishop limit (`genSum_RReg` at modulus
  `C·2ⁿ`); plus the public `qmul_le_left_mono`. Honest scope: integer points only,
  window-clamped twist; no continuous parameter, no transform pair, no inversion, no
  coupling; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 19 — the WINDOW POWER substrate of the Mellin twist** (new
  `Square/WindowPower.lean`): the transform's `tⁿ` twist grows on the half-line, so it is no
  single global test — but on each window `[m+1, m+2]` it is one: `bandTest m` (the
  `qBandQ`-clamped identity: 1-Lipschitz, bounded by `m+2`, INERT on its window,
  `bandTest_inert ≈ t`) and `powWinTest m n` (its `n`-th power by iterated `L2Test.mul` —
  certificates compose automatically through the test algebra; `powWinTest_succ_inert`:
  recursively `≈ (previous)·t` on the window, base `≡ 1`, so the window power IS `tⁿ`
  there). The twisted integrand of the transform at integer `n` on window `m` is the algebra
  product `φ · powWinTest m n` — automatic certificates, agreeing with `φ(t)·tⁿ` on the
  window. The twisted tail (summing window integrals under exponent-strengthened decay) is
  the banked next brick. Honest scope: per-window powers and inertness only — no transform,
  no tail, no pair; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 18 — THE MELLIN FRONT OPENED: the decaying test class and
  `∫₀^∞ φ`** (new `Analysis/MellinDecay.lean`): `riemannIntegralI_abs_le_window` — the
  missing bridge from pointwise to window data: an integrand bounded by `B` on `[a, a+w]`
  has `|∫_a^{a+w} f| ≤ w·B` (window-local comparison against `±B`-constants, whose interval
  integrals evaluate through certificate independence); `MellinTest` — an `L2Test` bundled
  with quadratic pointwise decay `|f| ≤ C/(m+1)²` per window; `mellinTerm_bound` — the
  derived two-sided `C/((m+1)m)` gateway data; **`mellinIntegral φ = ∫₀^∞ φ`** — the
  certified full Mellin-domain integral of every decaying test (compact gateway piece plus
  convergent half-line tail), with nonnegativity. The `f,f̂` objects live over this domain;
  the transform's `t^{s−1}` twist is the banked next brick. Honest scope: the half-line
  integral only — NOT the Mellin transform (no twist, no pair, no inversion); crux `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 17 — THE TRUNCATION-UNIFORM COMPLETION** (new
  `Square/UniformCompletion.lean`): the fixed-truncation fence of brick 15 removed —
  `limMember_coherent` (the limit coordinates are truncation-COHERENT: members built at any
  two truncations agree where both are defined, since both are Bishop limits of sequences
  pointwise `≈ F j i`); `limMemberU` (the diagonal member — ONE infinite object, coordinate
  `i` built at truncation `i+1`); `limMemberU_eq` (it agrees with every fixed-truncation
  member on its range); **`limMemberU_converges`** — for a truncation-uniform squared-Cauchy
  sequence (`SqCauchyU`), the single member satisfies `d²(F j, limMemberU) ≤ N·(2/(j+1))²`
  at EVERY truncation: strong convergence of one uniformly constructed infinite object,
  choice-free. Honest scope: per-`N` rate with a uniform CONSTRUCTION, not a
  truncation-uniform rate (that needs genuine ℓ² summability data, fenced open); the L²
  function-space strong completeness remains the last completeness lack; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 16 — THE SONINE COMPLEMENT IS CLOSED UNDER COMPLETION**
  (new `Square/CompleteComplement.lean`): `limMember_band_zero` — band-vanishing Cauchy
  sequences have band-vanishing limit members (the band coordinate of the limit is the limit
  of the band coordinates); **`sonine_complement_complete`** — the skeleton's unconditional
  complement-positivity survives the passage to limits: the Weil multiplier pairing of every
  constructed limit member is `≥ 0` at every truncation. The completion arc closes its loop
  with the skeleton dichotomy: the projection subspace is complete and positivity is not
  lost in the limit — so what step 4 must supply is exactly the coupling BEYOND this closed
  subspace, not limit bookkeeping inside it. Honest scope: the skeleton's band condition
  only; nothing about the genuine `f,f̂` coupling (step 4, = RH); crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 15 — STRONG COMPLETENESS at fixed truncation: the limit
  member CONSTRUCTED** (new `Square/Completion.lean`): for a `dist2`-Cauchy sequence
  (`SqCauchy`, the canonical sqrt-free squared modulus), the limit member exists as a
  CONSTRUCTION — each coordinate is the extended pairing against the indicator basis
  (`limMember F N hF = fun i => pairingLim F δᵢ`); `sqCauchy_pairing` transfers the modulus
  through `⟨δᵢ,δᵢ⟩ ≈ 1` (on the truncation) / `≈ 0` (beyond); `limMember_coord_dist` gives
  the coordinatewise canonical rate `2/(j+1)` (the coefficients ARE the coordinates, brick
  11); **`limMember_converges`** — `d²(F j, limMember) ≤ N·(2/(j+1))²`: every Cauchy
  sequence converges in `dist2` to its constructed limit, choice-free, with an effective
  rate. The pre-Hilbert space at fixed truncation is COMPLETE. Honest scope: fixed
  truncation only — the truncation-uniform completion and the L² strong completeness remain
  open; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 14 — the L² MIRROR of the completion axis** (new
  `Square/PairingLimitI.lean`): `L2Test.neg`/`L2Test.sub` (closure under negation —
  reusing the existing `lip_neg`/`congr_neg` — and subtraction; with `add` and `mul` the
  test class is a commutative algebra with subtraction); `innerI_neg_left` (`⟨−φ,ψ⟩ ≈
  −⟨φ,ψ⟩` — the negated test has the SAME product modulus definitionally, one congruence +
  `riemannIntegral_neg`) and `innerI_sub_left`; `dist2I` (the L² squared distance);
  `innerI_sub_sq_le` (L² Cauchy–Schwarz continuity, from brick 9's integral CS at the
  difference test); **`pairingILim`** — the L² pairings along a squared-Cauchy sequence of
  tests are `RReg` and their Bishop limit exists with effective rate `≤ 2/(j+1)`
  (`pairingILim_dist`). The completion axis is now open on BOTH the discrete and the
  function-space side. Honest scope: pairing values only; no completed L², no limit member,
  no strong convergence, nothing toward `f,f̂`; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 13 — THE PAIRING EXTENDS TO CAUCHY SEQUENCES: the
  completion axis opened** (new `Square/PairingLimit.lean`): `inner_sub_sq_le` — the
  Cauchy–Schwarz continuity of the pairing, `(⟨f,g⟩−⟨f',g⟩)² ≤ d²(f,f')·⟨g,g⟩` (the modulus
  of continuity squared, since the substrate has no sqrt); `pairing_RReg` — a sequence of
  test families squared-Cauchy against `g` (`d²(Fⱼ,Fₖ)·⟨g,g⟩ ≤ (1/(j+1)+1/(k+1))²`) has
  `RReg` pairings, the squared modulus converting to the canonical linear rate through the
  existing `Rle_of_Rsq_le` (order-reflection of squaring) and `RReg_of_real_bound` (the
  completeness bridge); **`pairingLim`** — the extended pairing value `lim_j ⟨Fⱼ,g⟩` exists
  as a constructed real with the effective rate `pairingLim_dist` (`≤ 2/(j+1)`). The pairing
  extends past finite approximation — the weak-limit half of completeness, the honest
  constructive one available without countable choice. Honest scope: pairing values only, no
  completed space, no limit member, no strong convergence; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 12 — the PARALLELOGRAM LAW and the squared-distance
  geometry** (new `Square/Parallelogram.lean`): bilinearity completed on the second slot
  (`innerN_add_right`/`innerN_sub_right`); **`parallelogram`** —
  `⟨f+g,f+g⟩ + ⟨f−g,f−g⟩ ≈ 2⟨f,f⟩ + 2⟨g,g⟩` (bilinear expansion, the `±⟨f,g⟩, ±⟨g,f⟩` cross
  terms cancelling as multiset pairs in the `RsumL` normalizer) — the identity certifying the
  pairing is genuine inner-product geometry; `dist2 = ⟨f−g,f−g⟩` (the substrate has no sqrt,
  so the metric geometry runs on the square) with nonneg/self/symm and
  **`dist2_doubling`** — `d²(f,h) ≤ 2d²(f,g) + 2d²(g,h)`, the quasi-triangle inequality that
  Cauchy sequences and completions are phrased with sqrt-free, an immediate corollary of the
  parallelogram law. The completion axis now has its metric substrate. Honest scope: fixed
  truncation, no completion constructed, L² mirror banked (needs `L2Test.neg`); crux `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 11 — PARSEVAL at the full indicator basis** (new
  `Square/Parseval.lean`): at the complete finite basis the layer's Bessel inequality
  SATURATES — `fourierC_indic` (`⟨f,δₖ⟩_N ≈ f(k)`: the coefficients are the coordinates),
  `proj_indic_eq` (the projection onto the full basis is the identity on the truncation),
  **`parseval_indic`** (`Σ_{k<N} ⟨f,δₖ⟩² ≈ ⟨f,f⟩_N`), and `bessel_saturates_at_indic`
  (the ≤ and the ≈ side by side). The Bessel/Parseval boundary is now kernel-checked: the
  infinite-dimensional statement is exactly what a completion — and only a completion — would
  add. Honest scope: finite truncations; no infinite-dimensional Parseval, no completeness;
  crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 10 — the test ALGEBRA and the integer Mellin moments** (new
  `Square/TestAlgebra.lean`): `L2Test.mul` — the bounded-Lipschitz class is **closed under
  multiplication** with every certificate field an already-proven lemma (`l2L`/`l2lip`/`l2fc`/
  `l2bd`); with `L2Test.add` the class is a genuine function algebra, and pointwise product is
  the autocorrelation-side operation. `clamp01`/`clampTest` (the `[0,1]` band clamp as a
  1-Lipschitz test, inert on unit-interval rationals), `oneTest`, and `powTest n` (clamped
  monomials by iterated product — certificates compose automatically).
  **`mellinMoment φ n = ∫₀¹ φ·clamp01ⁿ`** — the integer-point Mellin data of every test as
  certified reals, with the uniform pairing bound (`innerI_abs_le`, now public) and the
  L²-boundedness of the moment functionals (`mellinMoment_cs`). Honest scope: the moment
  skeleton is to the transform what the discrete band skeleton is to the Sonine space — NOT
  the Mellin transform (no continuous parameter, no half-line, no inversion); crux `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 9 — THE INTEGRAL CAUCHY–SCHWARZ** (new
  `Square/IntegralCSFull.lean`): **`innerI_cauchy_schwarz`** — `⟨φ,ψ⟩² ≤ ⟨φ,φ⟩·⟨ψ,ψ⟩` for
  the L² pairing over the certified integral, sqrt-free, division-free, completion-free. The
  ε-collapse: `a² − bc = (a² − Aₖ²) + (Aₖ² − BₖCₖ) + (BₖCₖ − bc)` through the level-`(k+1)`
  dyadic sums — the middle `≤ 0` at every level (brick 8's per-level CS, i.e. brick 1's
  discrete Lagrange SOS through the sampled families), the outer two `O(1/(k+1))` via the
  effective error bound, the uniform sum bounds, and the product-difference telescope
  (`Rabs_prod_diff`); closed by the one-sided ε-collapse. With symmetry (brick 6) and
  bilinearity (brick 7), `innerI` now satisfies ALL the inner-product laws the discrete
  `innerN` does — the L² side of the step-3 layer has its Cauchy–Schwarz. Helpers:
  `Rabs_le_of_close`, `qmul_eps_le`/`qmul_eps_le_left`, `l2bd`. Crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 8 — per-level Cauchy–Schwarz + the effective dyadic error
  bound** (new `Square/IntegralCS.lean`): `riemannSum_cauchy_schwarz` — at every partition
  level `R_N(fg)² ≤ R_N(f²)·R_N(g²)`, because the `RsumN` core of a product Riemann sum IS
  (definitionally) brick 1's truncated inner product of the sampled families, so the discrete
  sqrt-free Cauchy–Schwarz applies and the uniform weight `1/(N+1)` squares out
  (`(wA)² ≈ w²A² ≤ w²BC ≈ (wB)(wC)`, `RprodL` reassociation); `riemannSum_abs_le` (bounded
  integrand ⟹ `|R_N(h)| ≤ M`); **`riemannIntegral_dyadic_dist`** — `|∫₀¹f − D_m| ≤ (⌈L⌉+2)/m`
  at every level `m ≥ 1` (telescoping Cauchy modulus to the schedule, distance-to-limit past
  it): every certified integral now carries an explicit rational error at every dyadic
  Riemann sum. These are the two analytic inputs of the integral Cauchy–Schwarz; the
  ε-collapse assembly is the banked next brick. Crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 7 — BILINEARITY of the L² pairing** (new
  `Analysis/IntegralBilinear.lean`): the bounded-Lipschitz test class is closed under addition
  (`L2Test.add`, summed certificates via the existing `Radd_lipschitz_real` + triangle);
  `lip_weaken` (a certificate at `L` is one at any `L' ≥ L`) puts all three integrands of a
  sum at the common modulus where `riemannIntegral_add` applies, and certificate independence
  moves each end back to its canonical certificate: **`innerI_add_left`**
  (`⟨φ+φ',ψ⟩ ≈ ⟨φ,ψ⟩+⟨φ',ψ⟩`) and `innerI_add_right` (by symmetry). With `innerI_symm`, the
  L² pairing is now a genuine symmetric additive pairing on the test class — the
  function-space mirror of brick 1's discrete `innerN` laws. Banked next: the integral
  Cauchy–Schwarz (uniform-weight Riemann-sum route). Crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 6 — CERTIFICATE INDEPENDENCE of the certified integral**
  (new `Analysis/IntegralCertIrrel.lean`): `riemannIntegral` depends only on the integrand,
  not on which Lipschitz certificate constructed it (`riemannIntegral_certif_irrel`). The
  engine: `genSum_gap` — the telescoping Cauchy modulus of the dyadic sums (`1/((m+1)m) =
  1/m − 1/(m+1)`, so the increment tail between levels `M ≤ M'` telescopes EXACTLY to
  `≤ K/M`, no geometric estimate); `Rabs_dist_Rlim` (two-sided `|X m − lim X| ≤ 2/(m+1)`,
  with the `RTendsTo_le_Rsub` mirror); `Rlim_eval_real_rate` (`Rlim_eval_real` at an
  arbitrary linear rate `C/(j+1)`); the two digamma schedules both reach level `≥ j+1` at
  index `j`, so the `L'`-scheduled sums converge to the `L`-scheduled limit at rate
  `(⌈L⌉+2)/(j+1)` and the Bishop limits agree. Payoff: **`innerI_symm`** — the L² pairing is
  honestly symmetric (`⟨φ,ψ⟩ ≈ ⟨ψ,φ⟩`, no shared-certificate caveat), a genuine symmetric
  pairing on the bounded-Lipschitz class. Scope: the base integral on `[0,1]`; improper and
  complex layers keep per-certificate congruences; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 5 — the L² PAIRING OVER THE CERTIFIED INTEGRAL** (new
  `Analysis/IntegralInner.lean`): `L2Test` bundles a test function with the gateway's data
  (rational Lipschitz modulus, rational global bound, the three certificates — the class the
  realized Weil tests live in); `innerI φ ψ = ∫₀¹ φ·ψ` is the certified integral of the
  product (certificate from the existing `Rmul_lipschitz`, constant `M_φL_ψ + M_ψL_φ`) — the
  first genuine function-space inner product of the step-3 layer, a constructed real, not an
  interface field; `innerI_self_nonneg` (`∫₀¹ φ² ≥ 0`) and `innerI_symm_certif` (symmetry at
  the shared product certificate). Banked next, in order: certificate-independence of
  `riemannIntegral` (the two-schedule limit comparison), bilinearity at a common weakened
  modulus, the integral Cauchy–Schwarz. Honest scope: no completion, no measure theory; crux
  fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 4 — the `N → ∞` passage: the truncated forms STABILIZE**
  (new `Square/StableInner.lean`): for finitely-supported test families (`FinSupp`) the
  truncated sums, inner products, and Weil pairings stop moving past the support bound
  (`RsumN_stable`/`innerN_stable`/`weilQuad_stable`), so the direct limit is ATTAINED —
  `innerN_welldef` and `weilQuad_welldef` make `⟨f,g⟩` and `weilQuad M c` genuine numbers on
  the finitely-supported space (any two truncations past the bound agree), collapsing the
  `∀ N` direct-limit quantifier of `WeilPSD` to a single value on each test; the band
  projection acts on the space (`FinSupp_bandProj`). Honest scope: stabilization on the dense
  finitely-supported subspace — no completion constructed; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 3 — orthogonal projection and BESSEL'S INEQUALITY** (new
  `Square/Projection.lean`): orthonormal families (`OrthoFam`), Fourier coefficients
  `cₖ = ⟨f,eₖ⟩_N`, the finite-rank projection `Pf = Σ cₖeₖ` with `proj_coeff` (coefficients
  reproduced, by sifting through orthonormality) and `inner_proj`/`proj_self_inner`
  (`⟨f,Pf⟩ ≈ Σcₖ² ≈ ⟨Pf,Pf⟩`); **`bessel`**: `Σ_{k<K} ⟨f,eₖ⟩² ≤ ⟨f,f⟩_N` via
  `⟨f−Pf, f−Pf⟩ ≥ 0` — constructive, sqrt-free, no division; `indic_ortho` (the coordinate
  indicators are the skeleton's orthonormal basis). THE SONINE INSTANCE: the skeleton's band
  restriction is now a genuine projection OPERATOR — `bandProj` is idempotent
  (`bandProj_idem`) and self-adjoint (`bandProj_self_adjoint`), and
  `bandProj_pairing_nonneg` gives `weilQuad (multForm burnolMult) (bandProj c) N ≥ 0` for
  EVERY test family, unconditionally — pairing ∘ projection ≥ 0 with no support hypothesis
  left to the caller. Honest scope: Bessel not Parseval — no completeness, no claim the band
  projection is the genuine `f,f̂` co-support coupling; crux fields `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 2 — self-adjoint operators at the truncated level** (new
  `Square/SelfAdjoint.lean`): kernels act as operators (`applyN B c N = (Σ_j B(i,j)cⱼ)ᵢ`); the
  Weil quadratic form IS the inner product against the action (`weilQuad_eq_inner`:
  `weilQuad B c N ≈ ⟨c, B·c⟩_N` — form language and operator language coincide); symmetric
  kernels are self-adjoint (`applyN_self_adjoint`: `⟨B·c, d⟩ ≈ ⟨c, B·d⟩`, via the new real
  finite Fubini `RsumN_swap`); and the Sonine skeleton's multiplier form is the motivating
  instance — symmetric (`multForm_sym`), diagonal (`applyN_multForm`: `((multForm α)·c)(i) ≈
  α(i)cᵢ`), self-adjoint (`multForm_self_adjoint`), with the Burnol pairing as its quadratic
  form (`burnol_pairing_eq_inner`) — the language step 4 (the band-coupling positivity) has to
  be phrased in. Honest scope: finite truncations, no completeness/spectral theory; crux `none`.
- **The pre-Hilbert layer, brick 1 — the Sonine route's step 3 OPENED** (new
  `Square/PreHilbert.lean`): the truncated inner product `⟨f,g⟩_N = Σ_{i<N} fᵢgᵢ` on test
  families, with the four inner-product laws (`innerN_symm`/`innerN_add_left`/
  `innerN_smul_left`/`innerN_self_nonneg`), prefix monotonicity of the squared norm
  (`innerN_self_mono` — the directed structure the completion-free layer works with), and the
  **sqrt-free Cauchy–Schwarz** (`cauchy_schwarz`) via the **Lagrange identity**
  (`lagrange_identity`): the Cauchy–Schwarz defect `⟨f,f⟩⟨g,g⟩ − ⟨f,g⟩²` is exhibited as the
  EXPLICIT sum of 2×2 minors `Σ_{i<j} (fᵢgⱼ − fⱼgᵢ)²` — no discriminant, no division, no square
  root (the substrate has none): the certificate is the SOS itself, the intrinsic-certificate
  shape of the discharge form realized unconditionally at the pre-Hilbert level. Plus the
  finite-sum plumbing (`RsumN_neg`/`RsumN_sub`/`RsumN_le_prefix`/`Rsub_sq_expand`). Honest
  scope: finite truncations only — no L², no completeness, no operators; crux fields `none`.
- **`t4WeilValue_pos` — `W(t4) > 0`: THE FIRST CERTIFIED POSITIVITY ON THE
  AUTOCORRELATION CONE with a live prime side** (new `Square/ConeSlot.lean`): `t4Slot`
  realizes the cone-shaped log-tent as a `WeilSlot` with every interface field a genuine
  constructed integral — poles `= t4PoleA + t4PoleB ≈ 9/4 + t4H²`, archimedean tail
  `= t4ArchTail ≈ t4H·log(3/2) − t4Dilog` (assembled from the compact reciprocal half,
  the constructed dilog, and the improper remainder; the `log 5` telescopes cancel,
  `t4ArchTail_eq`) — and `t4WeilValue_eq` gives the closed form with the dilog carried
  as the constructed object. The sign (margin `≈ +0.0558`) closes through `M = 512`
  harmonic wedges (`log 2`, `log 3/2`, `log 3`, both sides), the standing
  `log 4π`/`γ` brackets, the rational dilog lower bound, and one exact rational
  `decide`. NOT claimed: positivity for the cone — that uniform statement is RH; the
  crux fields stay `none`.
- **`t4Dilog_ge` — the dilog constructed and bounded, fully rationally** (new
  `Analysis/DilogPhi.lean`, `DilogPhiVal.lean`, `DilogPieces.lean`, `DilogValue.lean`):
  the last new object of the `W(t4)` campaign, `∫₁⁴ log x/(x−1) dx = −Li₂(−3) ≈ 1.93939`
  (no log closed form), realized through the kernel identity
  `log x/(x−1) = ∫₀¹ ds/(1+s(x−1))` — the removable singularity at `x = 1` REMOVED BY
  CONSTRUCTION. The kernel `Φ(u) = ∫₀¹ clampedInv 1 (1+s·band₍₀,₃₎(u)) ds` is a certified
  integral for every real `u` (16-Lipschitz via the integral of the pointwise bound;
  antitone at rationals); every inner sample at rational `(s,u)` is the exact rational
  `1/(1+su)`, so the level sums are single rationals (`phiRat`) and the monotone bracket
  collapses `Φ` to `decide` material. The three pieces `∫₀¹ Φ(c'+t) dt` sum to `t4Dilog`,
  and **`t4Dilog ≥ 1909/1000`** closes with one rational `decide` over `3×16×128`-point
  folds — no logs, no wedges anywhere in the bracket.
- **`riemannIntegral_anti_upper/lower` — the monotone dyadic bracket** (new
  `Analysis/MonotoneIntegral.lean`): for a sample-antitone integrand ONE finite dyadic
  sum brackets the certified integral, `D_M − V/2^M ≤ ∫₀¹ f ≤ D_M` — the refinement
  regroup factored Lipschitz-free (`riemannSum_refine_regroup`), antitone pair terms
  (`refine_anti`/`refine_gap`), the accumulated geometric level gap
  (`dyadicR_level_anti`/`level_gap`), and the limit transfer (`Rlim_le_const` + the new
  `const_le_Rlim` mirror) under the schedule `M ≤ digammaMidx L j` (arranged by
  weakening `L`). Plus `riemannIntegral_le_sample` (sample-only integrand comparison)
  and the reusables `RsumN_telescope`, `Rneg_Rsub_flip`, `Rle_Radd_of_Rsub_le`. The
  bracket engine for integrals with no closed form.
- **`t4B12/23/34/h/q` — the `t4PoleB` pieces, part 4: constructed and evaluated** (in
  `Analysis/T4PoleBPieces.lean`): the five interval integrals of `t4F(x)/x` over
  `[1/4, 4]`, each a genuine constructed `riemannIntegral` — the three unit pieces
  `t4H·recip − ½·gLx` at shared modulus `2 + LxQ c`, the `[1/2,1]` piece
  `log2·recip + ½·gLx`, the `[1/4,1/2]` piece `½·gLx` (the substitution constant
  cancels the cone height, as in poleA) — with values `t4H·Δlog_c − ½ΔHn_c`,
  `log2·Δlog₁ + ½ΔHn₁`, `½ΔHn₁`. `t4PoleB` (the five-piece sum) is defined; the
  `4(log2)² = t4H·t4H` assembly is the companion brick. Axiom-clean; crux fields
  `none`.
- **`t4Improper_eq` — the `t4` arch tail, part 2: the improper remainder** (new
  `Analysis/T4TailImproper.lean`): `∫₁^∞ (1/(w+2) − 1/(w+4)) dw ≈ log 5 − log 3` —
  the substituted `∫₄^∞ 2/(x²−1) dx`, the second evaluated `improperIntegral1` (the
  shifted mirror of the tent\'s): blocks pull back to `gRecipC (m+3) − gRecipC (m+5)`
  and evaluate by `recipC_gen`; the partial sums telescope
  (`(log(N+3) − log3) − (log(N+5) − log5)`, `tail_step_alg`); block decay `K = 3`;
  deviation `≤ (2N+7)/((N+4)(N+3))` against the `K = 3` schedule. Remaining for the
  tail: the dilog half (`∫₁⁴ log x/(x−1)`, two-sided bracket) and the slot assembly.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`t4Trecip_sum` — the `t4` arch tail, part 1: the compact reciprocal half** (new
  `Analysis/T4ArchPieces.lean`): the arch tail\'s compact integrand on `[1,4]`
  collapses to `2log2/(x+1) − log x/(x−1)`; the reciprocal half is realized as three
  constructed pieces `∫₀¹ t4H/(b+t) dt ≈ t4H·(log(b+1) − log b)` (bases `2, 3, 4`,
  `riemannIntegral_recipC_smul` at weakened modulus `5`), telescoping to
  `t4H·(log5 − log2)`. Remaining for the tail: the dilog half (`log x/(x−1)`,
  two-sided bracket) and the improper remainder (`−t4H·(log5 − log3)`, the
  `TentArchTail` telescope mirror). Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`t4PoleB_eq` — `t4PoleB ≈ (2log2)² = 4(log2)²`, EXACT** (in
  `Analysis/T4PoleBPieces.lean`): the cone tent\'s `∫ f/x` pole component evaluates to
  the exact square `t4H·t4H`. The five constructed pieces (`t4B12/23/34/h/q`, part 4)
  telescope: the upper `A`-cluster gives `t4H·(log4 − log1) = t4H·t4H` and the
  `B`-cluster `−(1/2)·(Hn4 − Hn1) = −(1/2)·t4H·t4H` (both `log3`/`Hn3` drop without
  expansion), the lower pieces give `log2² + log2² = (1/2)·t4H·t4H`, and the halves
  cancel to the square. The SECOND `t4` slot component pinned (after `t4PoleA = 9/4`);
  remaining for `W(t4)`: the archimedean tail (recipC pieces + the dilog bracket) and
  the sign theorem. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`t4B_lower_eval` — the `t4PoleB` pieces, part 3: the lower pieces** (in
  `Analysis/T4PoleBPieces.lean`): `∫₀¹ (C·(1/(c+t)) + (1/2)·gLx c) dt ≈ C·Δlog_c +
  (1/2)·ΔHn_c`, generic in the bounded real constant — the `[1/2, 1]` piece at
  `C = log 2` and the `[1/4, 1/2]` piece\'s scaffold. The simplifying observation:
  the poleB measure `dx/x` is scale-INVARIANT, so the sub-unit pieces pull back with
  NO outer weight (`[1/2,1] ↦ (log2 + log(1+t))/(1+t) dt` exactly). Next: the five
  instances and the `4(log2)²` assembly. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`t4B_upper_eval` — the `t4PoleB` pieces, part 2: the upper pieces** (in
  `Analysis/T4PoleBPieces.lean`): `∫₀¹ (t4H·(1/(c+t)) + (−1/2)·gLx c) dt ≈
  t4H·(log(c+1) − log c) − (1/2)·(Hn(c+1) − Hn(c))` — the pulled-back
  `∫_c^{c+1} (2log2 − log x)/x dx`, general in the base (`1 ≤ c ≤ 3`) with the
  weakening certificates (`Qle` to the shared modulus) as decidable hypotheses;
  through `riemannIntegral_add`, the real-scalar reciprocal engine at `B = 2`, and
  the `gLx` engine. Next: the three upper instances, the two lower pieces
  (`(1/2)`, `(1/4)`-weighted), and the `4(log2)²` assembly. Axiom-clean; crux fields
  `none`.
- **`smul_lip`/`add_lip` + `t4H_abs` — the `t4PoleB` pieces, part 1: the combinators**
  (new `Analysis/T4PoleBPieces.lean`): the generic Lipschitz combinators the poleB
  piece integrands (`C·gRecipC + q·gLx`) consume — `|C| ≤ B` gives `C·f` at `B·L_f`;
  `f + g` at `L_f + L_g` — plus the cone-height bounds `0 ≤ t4H = 2log2 ≤ 2` and
  `|log 2| ≤ 1`, feeding `riemannIntegral_recipC_smul` at `B = 2` resp. `B = 1`.
  Next: the five piece definitions and evaluations, then the `4(log2)²` assembly.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`riemannIntegral_recipC_smul` — the real-scalar reciprocal evaluation** (new
  `Analysis/RecipSmulEval.lean`): `∫₀¹ C·(1/(c+t)) dt ≈ C·(log(c+1) − log c)` for a
  REAL constant `C` with `|C| ≤ B`, `B.num ≤ 5` — the first real-scalar integral
  evaluation, possible because the reciprocal family\'s Riemann sums are EXACT
  rationals (`riemannSum_gRecipC = hFold`), so the dyadic sums scale by `C` exactly
  (`riemannSum_smul` is real-scalar) and the defect is `|C|·wedge ≤ B/(c(c+1)2^m)`.
  This is the engine the `t4` poleB pieces need for their `2log2·(1/x)` halves; the
  `(1/2)·gLx` halves use the rational-scalar API. Next: the five poleB pieces and the
  `4(log2)²` assembly. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`riemannIntegral_gLx1/2/3` — the `∫ log/x` layer COMPLETE: the evaluation** (in
  `Analysis/LogOverXEval.lean`): `∫₀¹ 2·log(c+t)/(c+t) dt ≈ Hn(c+1) − Hn(c)`
  (`= log²(c+1) − log²c`), certified for `c = 1, 2, 3` at the product-Lipschitz datum
  `2c+2` — the THIRD certified evaluation family (after the harmonic `recipC` and the
  `∫log` `Gn` families), and the engine `poleB = 4(log2)²` consumes. Assembly: the
  anchor `D₀ = (1/c)·2·log c`, the schedule rate at any `midx ≥ 5(j+1)` (discharged
  per instance: `2c+3 ≥ 5`), `Rlim_eval_real`. Next: the five `t4` poleB pieces and
  the `4(log2)²` assembly (mirror of `t4PoleA`). Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`dyadicR_gLx_defect` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 8b-ii: the dyadic defect** (new
  `Analysis/LogOverXEval.lean`): `|D_m − (Hn(c+1) − Hn(c))| ≤ (5m+5)/2^m` — the
  convergence core of `∫₀¹ 2log(c+t)/(c+t) dt`. The deviation decomposes exactly
  (`lxe_insert`) into the sample-bracket slack (`≤ (2m+5)·2^m/A²`, capped gap + the
  `M/A²` reverse) plus the cross term `2·log(2^m)·(Δlog − hFold)` (`≤ 2m/(c(c+1)2^m)`,
  the harmonic wedge absorbing the scale identity\'s cross term), totalling
  `(4m+5)/2^m`. GOTCHA confirmed: `ring_uor` mis-atomizes repeated cast occurrences
  (`↑2^m` thrice) — use core `Int.add_mul`/`Int.mul_assoc` on cast-heavy goals.
  Remaining: the `digammaMidx` rate + `Rlim_eval_real` + instances. Axiom-clean; crux
  fields `none`.
- **`lxr_cap` + `Hn_sample_upper_cap` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 8b-i: the rate
  ingredients** (new `Analysis/LogOverXRate.lean`): the schedule arithmetic
  `5(j+1) ≤ m ⟹ (5m+5)(j+1) ≤ 2^m` (via `m(m+1) ≤ 2^m`, `m ≥ 5`), the per-cell
  log-sum cap `≤ 2m + 4` at `M = 2^m` (`logN_mono` into `(c+1)2^m`, split by
  `logN_mul_gen`, `log(c+1) ≤ 2`, `log(2^m) ≤ m`), the capped sample bracket
  `hsSample ≤ ΔHn + gapQE`, and the rational collapse `gapQE ≤ E·c/A²`. What remains
  for `∫₀¹ 2log(c+t)/(c+t) = Hn(c+1) − Hn(c)`: the rate core (triangle over the
  three slack terms + `Hn_scale_diff` + `hFoldC_defect`) and the `Rlim` wiring.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`hsFold_gap_cap` + `logN_two_pow_le` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 8a: the
  log-aware gap** (in `Analysis/LogSqStep.lean`): the rate ledger showed the part-3
  crude cap does NOT decay once unscaled (the sample fold is already the scaled
  Riemann sum), so the fold gap is re-proven with an arbitrary per-cell log-sum cap
  `E` (`hsFold_gap_cap`, cells `E/((A+j)(A+j+1))`), fed by the new magnitude bounds
  `log 2 ≤ 1` (`Rlog_le_sub_one` at the rational base) and `log(2^m) ≤ m`
  (`logN_pow_two` + the `k·x ≤ k` fold) — at `M = 2^m` the cap is `E ~ 2m + 4` and
  the telescoped gap is `~ m/M`, which the `digammaMidx` schedule absorbs
  (`m² ≤ 2^m`). Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`Hn_scale_diff` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 7: the scale identity** (in
  `Analysis/LogSqStep.lean`): `Hn(kM) ≈ Hn(k) + (2·log M·log k + Hn(M))`
  (`Hn_scale_expand`, the `(a+b)²` expansion over `logN_mul_gen`) and the difference
  `Hn((c+1)M) − Hn(cM) ≈ (Hn(c+1) − Hn(c)) + 2·log M·(log(c+1) − log c)` — `Hn(M)`
  and `log²M` cancel, leaving exactly the cross term that the collapse\'s
  `−2·log(N+1)·hFold` will absorb (`hFoldC_defect`: `hFold ≈ log(c+1) − log c` within
  `1/(c(c+1)M)`). All pieces for the `gLx` rate are now on the table. Axiom-clean;
  crux fields `none`.
- **`riemannSum_gLx` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 6: the point values and the Riemann
  fold** (new `Analysis/LogOverXSum.lean`): `gLx c (j/(N+1)) ≈ 2(log(c(N+1)+j) −
  log(N+1))·(N+1)/(c(N+1)+j)` (`gLx_point`, free from `gLog_point` + `gRecipC_point`),
  the fold `Σ_{i<k} gLx ≈ (N+1)·hsSample(c(N+1), k) − 2log(N+1)·harmTermFoldC(k)`
  (`RsumN_gLx` — the log² content lands in `LogSqStep`'s sample fold, the cross term in
  `HarmonicLogC`'s harmonic fold), and the collapse `riemannSum (gLx c) N ≈
  hsSample(c(N+1), N+1) − 2log(N+1)·hFold(c(N+1), N+1)` (`riemannSum_gLx`). Next: the
  `Hn` scale identity (`(a+b)²` expansion over `logN_mul_gen`) and the rate.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`gLx` + `gLx_lip_of` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 5: the integrand family** (new
  `Analysis/LogOverX.lean`): the totalized integrand
  `gLx c t = (gLog c t + gLog c t)·gRecipC c t` (`= 2·log(c+t)/(c+t)` on `[0,1]`) with
  the full gateway data — the uniform bounds `0 ≤ gLog c ≤ c` (`gLog_le`, the first
  consumer of `RlogPos_le_sub_one`: `log x ≤ x − 1` at the presented band modulus) and
  `|gRecipC| ≤ 1` (`Rinv_le_ofQ_inv` over the clamp floor), the doubled-integrand
  `2`-Lipschitz combinator `twoF_lip` (generic in the `1`-Lipschitz factor), and the
  product-Lipschitz certificate `gLx_lip_of` at constant `2c·1 + 1·2 = 2c + 2`
  (`Rmul_lipschitz` — its first gateway consumer). The objects
  `riemannIntegral (gLx c)` construct for `c = 1, 2, 3`. Next: the point values and
  the rate against `Hn(c+1) − Hn(c)`. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`Hn_sample_upper/lower` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 4b: the two-sided sample
  bracket** (in `Analysis/LogSqStep.lean`): the reverse slack `hsFoldHi ≤ hsSample +
  c/A²` (per cell the weighted log step `δ/(A+k) ≤ 1/(A+k)² ≤ 1/A²`, summed at the
  common denominator `A²`), and the combined bracket
  `(Hn(A+M) − Hn(A)) − M/A² ≤ hsSample ≤ (Hn(A+M) − Hn(A)) + gapQ` — the sample fold
  (the exact `log/x` Riemann-sum shape) is now two-sided against the `log²`
  antiderivative difference, with both slacks decaying like `1/M` after scaling. Next:
  the `log/x` integrand family and the rate wiring. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`hsSample_le_foldHi` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 4a: the sample fold** (in
  `Analysis/LogSqStep.lean`): `hsSample = Σ_{j<c} 2·log(A+j)/(A+j)` — the exact shape
  the `log/x` Riemann sums take — with the cell-wise comparison
  `hsSample ≤ hsFoldHi` (`2·log(A+j) ≤ log(A+j) + log(A+j+1)` by `logN_mono`, same
  weight). With the telescopes and the fold gap this brackets the sample fold against
  `Hn(A+c) − Hn(A)` from above; the reverse slack (`foldHi ≤ sample + c/A²`, via the
  step bracket squared) is the next brick. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`hsFold_gap` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 3: the fold gap** (in
  `Analysis/LogSqStep.lean`): `hsFoldHi ≤ hsFoldLo + Σ_{j<c} 2(K+1)/((A+j)(A+j+1))`
  for any cap `A + c ≤ K` — the KEY insight verified in the kernel: the crude
  `log n ≤ n` bound (`logN_le_self`) suffices, because the harmonic cells
  `1/((A+j)(A+j+1))` telescope to `≤ c/A²`, killing a factor of `A ~ cM` (the scaled
  defect decays like `1/M` with no log-precision anywhere). Per-cell:
  `Rmul_sub_distrib_right` collapses the weight difference to the harmonic cell.
  Next: the `log/x` Riemann fold comparison and the eval
  `∫₀¹ 2log(c+t)/(c+t) = Hn(c+1) − Hn(c)`. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`Hn_tele_lower/upper` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 2: the telescopes** (in
  `Analysis/LogSqStep.lean`; toward `poleB = 4(log2)²`): the step-folds
  `hsFoldLo/hsFoldHi` (`Σ_{j<c} (log(A+j) + log(A+j+1))·w` at the lower/upper step
  weights `w = 1/(A+j+1), 1/(A+j)`) and the two-sided telescope
  `Hn(A) + foldLo ≤ Hn(A+c) ≤ Hn(A) + foldHi`, general in the base and the count —
  the `Gn_tele` pattern one level up. Next: the fold gap and the `log/x` Riemann
  comparison. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`Hn_step_lower/upper` — the `∫ log/x` layer, part 1: the `log²` step bracket** (new
  `Analysis/LogSqStep.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 — the `W(t4)` campaign, toward
  `poleB = 4(log2)²`): the antiderivative object `Hn(n) = (log n)²` (`= 2·∫₁ⁿ log x/x`)
  with `Hn(1) ≈ 0` and the two-sided unit-step bracket
  `(log i + log(i+1))/(i+1) ≤ Hn(i+1) − Hn(i) ≤ (log i + log(i+1))/i`, GENERAL in `i` —
  the difference of squares collapses the step (`Rmul_sub_add_self`), the certified
  per-step log bracket (`ExpBounds`) bounds the first factor, and `Rnonneg_logN` carries
  the product. The exact mirror of `LogStep`'s `Gn` engine one level up; the telescopes
  over `i = c·2^m + j` and the `log/x` Riemann comparison are the next bricks.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`t4PoleA_eq` — `t4PoleA ≈ 9/4`, EXACT** (`Analysis/T4PoleAAssembly.lean` part 2;
  Sonine route, step 2 — the `W(t4)` campaign): the cone tent's `∫ f` pole component
  evaluates to the exact rational `9/4` — the `log 2` coefficient cancels
  (`−2 + 3/2 + 1/2 = 0`) and the rationals total `1 + 2 − 1/2 − 1/4 = 9/4`. Assembly
  through a normal form `a·log2 + q` (rational `a, q`): `Gn 2 − Gn 1 ≈ 2log2 − 1`
  (`gn21_nf`), `Gn 4 − Gn 2 ≈ 6log2 − 2` (`gn42_nf`, via `logN 4 ≈ 2·logN 2`), the
  telescoped middle `t4A23 + t4A34 ≈ −2log2 + 2`, `t4Ah ≈ (3/2)log2 − 1/2`,
  `t4Aq ≈ (1/2)log2 − 1/4`, summed by the NF kit (`ta_nf_add`/`ta_nf_smul` +
  scalar-collapse privates). First of the three `t4` slot components pinned; next:
  poleB (`= 4(log2)²`) and the archimedean tail (the dilog bracket). Axiom-clean;
  crux fields `none`.
- **`t4A12_val` + `t4A2334_val` — the `t4PoleA` assembly, part 1** (new
  `Analysis/T4PoleAAssembly.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 — the `W(t4)` campaign): the
  first *exact* piece value — `t4A12 ≈ 1` (`∫₁² (2log2 − log x) dx = 1`: the cone
  height is `Gn 2`'s own log term definitionally, so the logs cancel inside the
  piece) — and the middle-piece telescope `t4A23 + t4A34 ≈ (t4H + t4H) − (Gn 4 − Gn 2)`,
  which drops `Gn 3` (the assembly's only `log 3` carrier) without ever expanding it.
  Remaining for `t4PoleA ≈ 9/4`: expand `Gn 4 − Gn 2` through `logN 4 ≈ 2·logN 2`,
  fold in `t4Ah`/`t4Aq`, cancel the `log 2` coefficient (`6 − 8 + 3/2 + 1/2 = 0`).
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`t4A12/23/34/h/q` — the `t4PoleA` pieces, constructed and evaluated** (new
  `Analysis/T4PoleAPieces.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 — the `W(t4)` campaign): the five
  interval integrals of the cone tent `t4F(x) = 2log2 − |log x|` over `[1/4, 4]`, each
  a genuine constructed `riemannIntegral` in pulled-back unit form (`x = c + t` on
  `[c, c+1]` at `c = 1, 2, 3`; `x = (1+t)/2` and `x = (1+t)/4` on the sub-unit
  intervals, the substitution constants split by `log((1+t)w) = log(1+t) + log w` —
  on `[1/4, 1/2]` the split *exactly cancels* the cone height, leaving the bare
  `∫₀¹ log(1+t)`). Piece values kernel-evaluated against the `∫log` layer:
  `2log2 − (Gn(c+1) − Gn(c))` for the three unit pieces, `(1/2)(log2 + (Gn2 − Gn1))`,
  `(1/4)(Gn2 − Gn1)`. The generic vehicles `int_const_sub_eval`/`int_const_add_eval`
  (`∫(C ∓ f) = C ∓ ∫f`, any Real constant, any modulus) and the certificate
  combinators `lip_const_sub/add`, `lip_neg` (+ congr forms) are new reusable gateway
  API. `t4PoleA` (the five-piece sum) is defined; the assembly `t4PoleA ≈ 9/4` (the
  logs cancel exactly) is the companion brick. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`riemannIntegral_logC1/2/3` — the `∫ log` layer, part 2c(v): the evaluation — THE
  `∫ log` LAYER IS COMPLETE** (new `Analysis/LogIntegralEval.lean`; Sonine route,
  step 2 — the `W(t4)` campaign): `∫₀¹ log(c+t) dt ≈ Gn(c+1) − Gn(c)`
  (`= (c+1)log(c+1) − c·log c − 1`), certified for `c = 1, 2, 3` on the `1`-Lipschitz
  data — the second non-rational family of certified integral evaluations (after the
  harmonic `recipC` family), and the values the five `t4PoleA` pieces consume. The
  assembly: the dyadic defect `|D_m − (Gn(c+1) − Gn(c))| ≤ (1/2^m)·hFold(c·2^m, 2^m)
  ≤ 1/2^m` (`dyadicR_gLog_defect`, from the part 2c(iv) collapse + bracket + scale
  identity, with `hFold_le_ratio`: the harmonic block is at most `M/A`); the anchor
  `D₀ = gLog c (0) ≈ log c`; the `digammaMidx` schedule (`genSum_gLog_rate`) and
  `Rlim_eval_real` — the `HarmonicLogC` template end to end. General-base engine
  `riemannIntegral_logC_gen` (Lipschitz datum a hypothesis); root witness clauses for
  the three instances; audit entries. Next: the five `t4PoleA` pieces (`[k, k+1]` at
  `c = 1, 2, 3` direct; `[1/4, 1/2]`, `[1/2, 1]` by affine substitution with the log
  constants split off), whose logs cancel to the exact `9/4`. Axiom-clean; crux
  fields `none`.
- **`riemannSum_gLog` + `Gn_scale_identity` — the `∫ log` layer, part 2c(iv): the Riemann
  sums and the scale identity** (new `Analysis/LogRiemann.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 —
  the `W(t4)` campaign): the four structural facts turning the point values and the
  `LogStep` telescopes into the dyadic rate for `∫₀¹ log(c+t) dt` — the fold
  (`RsumN_gLog`: `Σ_{i<k} gLog c (i/(N+1)) ≈ logFold(c(N+1), k) − k·log(N+1)`, `k ≤ N+1`),
  the collapse (`riemannSum_gLog`: the full sum
  `≈ (1/(N+1))·logFold(c(N+1), N+1) − log(N+1)`), the two-sided bracket
  (`logFold_le_Gn`/`Gn_le_logFold`: `ΔGn − hFold(A,M) ≤ logFold(A,M) ≤ ΔGn`, closing
  `LogStep`'s telescopes into `Rle` pairs against `ΔGn = Gn(A+M) − Gn(A)`), and the
  scale identity (`Gn_scale_identity`:
  `(1/M)·(Gn((c+1)M) − Gn(cM)) ≈ (Gn(c+1) − Gn(c)) + log M`, via `Gn_scale_expand` —
  `logN_mul_gen` driven through the antiderivative). The `− log(N+1)` of the collapse
  exactly absorbs the `+ log M` of the identity, so the Riemann sums converge to
  `Gn(c+1) − Gn(c)` with defect `(1/M)·hFold(cM,M) ≤ 1/(cM)` — the rate at the
  `digammaMidx` schedule and `Rlim_eval_real` are the next brick. Axiom-clean; crux
  fields `none`.
- **`RlogPos_ofQ_eq_logN` + `gLog_point` — the `∫ log` layer, parts 2c(ii)–(iii): the
  log-of-rational bridge and the point values** (new `Analysis/LogRatBridge.lean`,
  `Analysis/LogPointVal.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 — the `W(t4)` campaign): (2c-ii)
  `RlogPos (ofQ ⟨a,d⟩) ≈ logN a − logN d` on the band `d ≤ a ≤ 4d`, by
  **exp-injectivity** — `exp(RlogPos(a/d) + logN d) ≈ (a/d)·d ≈ a ≈ exp(logN a)`
  (`RexpReal_add`, `Rexp_log_ratQ`, `Rexp_logN`), cancelled by the general
  `RexpReal_inj_gen` (no nonnegativity side conditions, so no `logN` monotonicity
  needed); the radius certificate consumed is exactly part 2c(i)'s `radius_half_proj`,
  fed to `RlogPos_eq_Rlog` at the presented modulus `B = a/d`. No new series, no new
  integral — an identity between two already-constructed logarithms. (2c-iii) the point
  values `gLog c (j/(N+1)) ≈ logN(c(N+1)+j) − logN(N+1)` for `1 ≤ c ≤ 3`, `j ≤ N+1`,
  GENERAL in the dyadic sample — every fold of every Riemann sum of `∫₀¹ log(c+t) dt`
  routes through this single theorem: the constant-real sum collapses
  (`c + j/(N+1) ≈ (c(N+1)+j)/(N+1)`), the band clamp is inert on the sample
  (`qBandQ_eq_of_band`), `RlogPos_congr` fires at `B = c+1`
  (`radius_half_proj (c+1) 1` — the two `c ≤ 3` constraints, the modulus certificate
  and the bridge band, are the same constraint), and the bridge lands the `logN`
  difference that `LogStep`'s telescopes speak. Root witness clause added (the ∀-shape
  point-value fact); audit entries added. Remaining for `riemannIntegral_logC`: the
  `genSum` rate (the `HarmonicLogC` schedule over `Gn`'s telescopes) and
  `Rlim_eval_real` wiring. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`qBandQ` + `gLog` + `radius_half_of_le4` — the `∫ log` layer, parts 2a–2c(i)** (new
  `Analysis/BandClamp.lean`, `Analysis/LogIntegrand.lean`, `Analysis/LogRatCert.lean`;
  Sonine route, step 2 — the `W(t4)` campaign): (2a) the two-sided per-index band clamp
  `qBandQ a b x` (`seqₙ = min(b, max(xₙ, a))`) with the new `Qmin` suite, `1`-Lipschitz,
  congruent, inert on the band, uniform positivity witness — the totalizer manufacturing
  exactly the seq-wise facts `RlogPos`'s lemmas consume; (2b) the totalized `log`
  integrand `gLog c t = RlogPos(band_{[1,c+1]}(c+t))`, its congruence and `1`-Lipschitz
  data general in the base with decidable certificate hypotheses, and the instances
  `c = 1, 2, 3` (budgets `K_B = 42/64/90`, `K_BB = 90/280/714`, all certs by `decide`;
  the presented-radius certs provably fail for `c ≥ 5` — concrete instances are the
  design). The gateway objects `riemannIntegral (gLog c)` now construct; (2c-i) the
  uniform small-radius certificate `2(a−d)² ≤ (a+d)²` for `d ≤ a ≤ 4d`, GENERAL in the
  dyadic sample via the witness identity `(a+d)² − 2(a−d)² = (4d−a)(a−d) + ad + 3d²`
  (`ring_uor` + `Int.mul_nonneg`, no size bound) — what lets `RlogPos_eq_Rlog` fire at
  every sample of `∫₀¹ log(c+t)` uniformly. Remaining for the evaluation: the
  log-of-rational bridge (exp-injectivity assembly), the `genSum` rate from `LogStep`'s
  telescopes, `riemannIntegral_logC`. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`Gn_step_lower`/`Gn_step_upper` + telescopes — the `∫ log` layer, part 1** (new
  `Analysis/LogStep.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 — the engine for the `W(t4)` campaign):
  with `Gn(n) = n·log n − n` (the `log` antiderivative at integer arguments,
  `Gn_one ≈ −1`), the unit step is bracketed by the endpoint samples,
  `Gn(i) + log i ≤ Gn(i+1) ≤ Gn(i) + log(i+1)` — PURE ALGEBRA over the per-step
  logarithm bracket (`ExpBounds.lean`): multiply `1/(i+1) + log i ≤ log(i+1)` by `i+1`
  (resp. `log(i+1) ≤ 1/i + log i` by `i`) and the rational parts collapse to `1`.
  Telescoping (`Gn_tele_lower`/`Gn_tele_upper`) gives the two-sided Riemann bound
  `Gn(A) + Σ_{j<c} log(A+j) ≤ Gn(A+c) ≤ Gn(A) + Σ_{j<c} log(A+j+1)`, and the fold gap
  is bounded by the EXISTING rational harmonic fold (`logFold_gap`:
  `Σ log(A+j+1) ≤ Σ log(A+j) + hFold A c`). Since the dyadic Riemann samples of a `log`
  integrand at rational points ARE `logN` differences at integer arguments
  (`log(c + j/2^m) = logN(c·2^m + j) − logN(2^m)`), this is exactly the rate content for
  `∫₀¹ log(c+t) dt = (c+1)·log(c+1) − c·log c − 1` at defect `hFold(c·2^m, 2^m) ≤ 1/(c·2^m)`
  — part 2 wires it into the gateway. Verified target (30-digit numeric check recorded):
  `W(t4) = 9/4 + 4(log 2)² − [primes + (log 4π + γ)·2 log 2 + tail] ≈ +0.0981 > 0`, the
  sign RH demands on the cone; the tail's dilog piece (`−Li₂(−3)`) will be certified by
  brackets, not closed form. Root witness extended with the step-bracket pair (∀-clause);
  axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`t4Test` + `t4PrimePart_eq` — THE FIRST CONE-SHAPED TEST DATUM WITH A LIVE PRIME SIDE**
  (new `Square/ConeTent.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 — toward the autocorrelation cone): the
  square-scale symmetric log-tent `t4F(x) = 2·log 2 − |log x|` on `[1/4, 4]` realized as a
  genuine `WeilTest` (`X = 4`). The key unblocking observation: in the log variable the
  test is the autocorrelation of the box on `[−log 2, log 2]` — the box with RATIONAL knots
  `[1/2, 2]` in `x` — so at SQUARE scales `X = c²` the `√2` obstruction (recorded against
  the scale-2 tent, generating box knots `2^{∓1/2}`) vanishes. The datum is log-valued at
  rational points (`f(a/b) = 2·log 2 ∓ (log a − log b)`), which `WeilTest.f : Q → Real`
  carries natively; `f(1) = 2·log 2 > 0` (`t4F_one`) is the on-cone marker `∫|g|²` that the
  off-cone bump lacked. The finite-place side is EVALUATED in closed form
  (`t4PrimePart_eq`): `primes(t4) ≈ log 2·(3/2·log 2) + log 3·(4/3·(2·log 2 − log 3))`
  `≈ 1.1421` — the prime `2` enters with the test's own log-weight (`Λ(2)·f(2) = (log 2)²`),
  the prime `3` through the symmetric pair `f(3) = f(1/3)`, and the `Λ(4) = log 2` term
  dies on the knot `f(4) = 0` by `log`-multiplicativity. HONEST SCOPE: datum + prime side
  only — the slot integrals need the certified `∫ log` layer (not yet built), and the exact
  CC weight normalization of the cone element is deliberately not asserted (`t4F` is
  claimed as the log-coordinate autocorrelation shape only). Root witness extended with
  `t4F_one` and `t4PrimePart_eq`; axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`bumpSlot` + `bumpWeilValue_neg` — THE FIRST REALIZED SLOT WITH A LIVE PRIME SIDE, and
  the first certified NEGATIVE Weil value: `W(bump) < 0`** (new `Analysis/BumpPieces.lean` +
  `Square/BumpSlot.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 — the frontier past the prime-free window):
  the off-center tent with knots `1, 2, 3` (peak AT the prime `2`) is realized as a genuine
  `WeilTest` (`bumpF : Q → Real`, `X = 3` — the first test whose support MEETS the primes;
  it is the genuine function whose consumed evaluations `demoWeilTest` records), and its
  `WeilSlot` is inhabited with every field a kernel-evaluated integral: poles
  `= bumpPoleA + bumpPoleB ≈ 1 + (3·log 3 − 4·log 2)` (`bump_pieceA1/A2` the affine edges,
  `bump_pieceB1/B2` the `f̃(0)` pieces `1 − 1/x` and `3/x − 1` through the reciprocal
  bridges), archimedean tail `= bumpArchTail ≈ 6·log 2 − 3·log 3` — COMPACT for this test:
  `f(1) = 0` kills both the `(2/x)f(1)` subtraction and the improper remainder, and the
  PV-cancelled integrand reduces by exact rational algebra (`x/(x+1) = 1 − 1/(x+1)` on
  `[1,2]`; partial fractions `−1 + 1/(x−1) + 2/(x+1)` on `[2,3]`, consuming the base-3
  bridge `∫₀¹ dx/(3+x) ≈ log 4 − log 3`). The finite-place side is NONZERO
  (`bumpPrimePart_eq ≈ log 2` — the prime `2` enters the assembled functional through the
  peak, `Λ(3)` dying on the right knot), the archimedean constant vanishes (`f(1) = 0`),
  and the value reduces to closed form (`bumpWeilValue_eq`):
  `W(bump) = 1 + 6·log 3 − 11·log 2 ≈ −0.0329`. **`bumpWeilValue_neg` certifies
  `W(bump) < 0`** via the harmonic wedges at `M = 128` (`bmp_L2`/`bmp_U32`/`bmp_L43`;
  worst-case wedge error `7/256 ≈ 0.027` against margin `0.033`, realized margin `≈ 0.024`;
  one closing bignum `decide`). WHAT THE SIGN MEANS: the Weil criterion is positivity on
  the AUTOCORRELATION cone `g ⋆ g^τ`, and the bump is admissible but NOT an autocorrelation
  (`f(1) = ∫|g|² = 0` forces `g = 0`) — so a certified `W < 0` is CONSISTENT with RH and is
  the honest counterpart of `tentWeilValue_pos`: kernel-checked proof that Weil positivity
  is NOT a pointwise feature of the admissible class — the `f, f̂` coupling structure
  (Sonine steps 3–4) is load-bearing. The cancellation-not-magnitude finding (`α(2) < 0`,
  `arch(1) < 0`), now at the level of the assembled functional. Root witness extended with
  both facts; axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`tentSlot` + `tentWeilValue_pos` — THE FIRST REALIZED WEIL SLOT, and the first realized
  window-positivity instance: `W(tent) > 0`** (new `Square/TentSlot.lean`; Sonine route,
  step 2 boundary crossed for one genuine test): `Pairing.lean`'s `WeilSlot` interface is
  INHABITED with every field a kernel-evaluated constructed integral — the tent test datum
  `tentF : Q → Real` (piecewise-linear, knots `1/2, 1, 2`, Bombieri-admissible, support
  proofs kernel-checked), poles `= tentPoleA + tentPoleB ≈ 3/4 + log 2`, archimedean tail
  `= tentArchTail ≈ −1 − 6·log 2 + 3·log 3`. The finite-place side VANISHES
  (`tentPrimePart_eq` — the `X = 2` prime-free window realized: the knots sit exactly at
  the prime-2 evaluation points), the archimedean constant collapses (`f(1) = 1`), and the
  Weil functional reduces to closed form (`tentWeilValue_eq`):
  `W(tent) ≈ (3/4 + log 2) − ((log 4π + γ) + (−1 − 6·log 2 + 3·log 3))
   = 7/4 + 7·log 2 − 3·log 3 − log 4π − γ ≈ +0.198`. **`tentWeilValue_pos` certifies
  `W(tent) > 0`** — rational brackets for `log 2` and `log 3 − log 2` come from the
  harmonic wedges at `M = 32` (`tent_L2`/`tent_U32`/`tent_L32`/`tent_L3`: the fold values
  are exact rationals with ~10⁵⁰-digit-product denominators; ONE closing `decide` performs
  the bignum arithmetic), `log 4π`/`γ` from the standing brackets. This is what
  window-supported Weil positivity LOOKS like when realized — one test, one certified sign;
  the pairing-family positivity (`∀` tests) remains the crux and is RH. Axiom-clean; crux
  fields `none`.
- **`tentArchTail_eq` — the tent's full archimedean tail ≈ `−1 − 6·log 2 + 3·log 3`: THE
  THIRD EVALUATED WEIL-SLOT COMPONENT, completing all three tent slot fields** (new
  `Analysis/TentArchTail.lean`; Sonine route, step 2): the improper part past the support,
  `∫₁^∞ (1/w − 1/(w+2)) dw = ∫₂^∞ 2/(x²−1) dx ≈ log 3` (`improperTail_eq`), is the FIRST
  EVALUATED `improperIntegral1` — a certified half-line integral reduced in the kernel. Each
  unit block `T m = ∫_{m+1}^{m+2} hTail` is two instances of the general-base bridge
  (`integralTerm_hTail : T m ≈ [log(m+2)−log(m+1)] − [log(m+4)−log(m+3)]`); the `K = 3`
  decay hypothesis comes from the per-step logarithm bracket (`T m ∈ [1/(m+2) − 1/(m+3),
  1/(m+1) − 1/(m+4)] ⊆ [0, 3/((m+1)m)]`, `tail_decay`); the partial sums TELESCOPE
  (`genSum_hTail : Σ_{i<N} T i ≈ (log(N+1) − log 1) − (log(N+3) − log 3)`, a three-line
  additive rearrangement per step, `tail_step_alg`); the defect `log(N+3) − log(N+1) ≤
  2/(N+1)` (the bracket twice) beats the schedule `digammaMidx 3 j = 4(j+1)`, and
  `Rlim_eval_real` evaluates the limit. Assembled: `tentArchTail = tent_arch12 −
  improperTail ≈ −(1 + 2·log 2 − 4·(log 3 − log 2)) − log 3 = −1 − 6·log 2 + 3·log 3`.
  With `tentPoleA_eq` (3/4), `tentPoleB_eq` (log 2), and `weilArchConst` already
  constructed, ALL `WeilSlot` interface fields for the tent test are now kernel-evaluated —
  the realized slot instance and `weilValue` are the next (assembly) brick. Axiom-clean;
  crux fields `none`.
- **`riemannIntegral_recipC` — the GENERAL-BASE harmonic bridge: `∫₀¹ dx/(c+x) ≈
  log(c+1) − log c` for EVERY natural base `c ≥ 1`** (new `Analysis/HarmonicLogC.lean`;
  Sonine route, step 2): the `HarmonicLog32` construction with the base as a parameter —
  left sums are `H_{(c+1)M} − H_{cM}`, the wedge telescopes `cM → (c+1)M` with width
  `1/(c(c+1)M)` (both cancellations by `logN_mul_gen`), anchor `D₀ = 1/c`. This is the
  block engine the improper archimedean tail needs: `∫₂^∞ −2/(x²−1) dx = −log 3` is a
  `genSum` of unit blocks `∫_{m+1}^{m+2}(1/w − 1/(w+2))` (`ImproperIntegral.lean`), and each
  block is `[log(m+2)−log(m+1)] − [log(m+4)−log(m+3)]` — two instances of this theorem;
  the partial sums telescope to `log 3 − (log(N+3) − log(N+1))` with defect `≤ 2/(N+1)` by
  the per-step bracket, so `Rlim_eval_real` will close the tail. Wired into the root witness
  as a universally-quantified clause (`∀ c ≥ 1`). Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`tent_arch12` — the archimedean tail's compact `[1,2]` piece ≈ `−1 − 6·log 2 + 4·log 3`,
  and general log-additivity** (new `Analysis/HarmonicLog32.lean`,
  `Analysis/TentArchPiece.lean`; Sonine route, step 2): the PV-cancelled tail integrand on
  the tent's support, `∫₁² −(1 + 2/x − 4/(x+1)) dx`, is CONSTRUCTED (floor-1 clamp only —
  `x ≥ 1`, `x+1 ≥ 2` on the domain) and EVALUATED:
  `≈ −(1 + 2·log 2 − 4·(log 3 − log 2))`. The new core is
  **`riemannIntegral_recip32`: `∫₀¹ dx/(2+x) ≈ log 3 − log 2`** — the base-`2M` harmonic
  bridge (left sums are `H_{3M} − H_{2M}`, the wedge telescopes the per-step bracket from
  `2M` to `3M` with width `1/(6M)`), whose only new analytic input is
  **`logN_mul_gen`: `log(k·m) = log k + log m`** (the `logN_mul` doubling proof at an
  arbitrary factor, via `exp` injectivity — `HarmonicLog`'s folds and telescopes were
  already general in base and count). The pullback is pointwise congruent to
  `−(1 + 2·gRecip − 4·gRecip32)` (`tent_arch_pull`) and gateway linearity reduces the value
  to the two certified reciprocal integrals. Remaining for the full tail
  `−1 − 6·log 2 + 3·log 3`: the improper piece past the support,
  `∫₂^∞ −2/(x²−1) = −log 3`. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`tentPoleB_eq` — the tent's `f̃(0)` component ≈ `log 2`: THE SECOND EVALUATED WEIL-SLOT
  COMPONENT, and the first integral evaluation to a NON-RATIONAL value** (new
  `Analysis/ExpBounds.lean`, `Analysis/HarmonicLog.lean`, `Analysis/TentLogPiece.lean`;
  Sonine route, step 2): the tent test's `∫₀^∞ f(x)/x dx` pole part is CONSTRUCTED as two
  certified interval integrals and EVALUATED in the kernel:
  `∫_{1/2}^{1}(2 − 1/x) + ∫_{1}^{2}(2/x − 1) ≈ (1 − log 2) + (2·log 2 − 1) = log 2`.
  With `tentPoleA_eq` this completes the tent's pole block `f̃(1) + f̃(0) = 3/4 + log 2`.
  The chain, bottom-up: (i) **`ExpBounds.lean`** — the series bounds `1 + q ≤ exp q`
  (`RexpReal_ofQ_ge_one_add`) and the exact geometric cap `exp(1/(e+1)) ≤ (e+1)/e`
  (`RexpReal_unit_le`, strengthened-induction closed form `expSum_unit_le_geom`), giving the
  **per-step logarithm bracket** `1/(i+1) ≤ log(i+1) − log i ≤ 1/i` (`logN_step_lower/upper`,
  via `RexpReal_reflects_le` — the constructive derivative of `log` at the integers);
  (ii) **`HarmonicLog.lean`** — the telescoped wedge `log 2 ≤ Σ_{j<M} 1/(M+j) ≤ log 2 + 1/(2M)`
  (`log2_le_hFold`/`hFold_le_log2_add`, through `logN_mul` and the exact telescoping defect
  `hFold_eq_hFoldLo`), the harmonic Riemann-sum identity `R_N(1/(1+t)) = Σ_{j<M} 1/(M+j)`
  (`riemannSum_gRecip`, per-point `clampedInv` evaluation + ℚ-fold), the new limit engine
  `Rlim_eval_real` (rate-convergent Bishop limits evaluate to a REAL target — `Rlim_eval`
  generalized, one extra regularity step of the target), and the headline
  **`riemannIntegral_recip`: `∫₀¹ dx/(1+x) ≈ log 2`** — the constructive
  fundamental-theorem step for `1/x`; (iii) **`TentLogPiece.lean`** — the two tent pieces
  totalized with the FLOOR-1 clamp only (on `[1/2,1]` via `1/x = 2·(1/(2x))`, `2x ∈ [1,2]` —
  no second clamp floor, no scaling identity), affine pullbacks POINTWISE congruent to
  `2 − 2·gRecip` and `2·gRecip − 1` (`tent_pull1/2`), evaluated by gateway linearity
  (`_const/_smul/_neg/_add`) over `riemannIntegral_recip`, assembled in `tentPoleB_eq`.
  Also: order helpers (`Rsub_le_of_le_Radd`, `Radd_le_cancel_right`, `Rsub_shift_drop`,
  `Rneg_involutive`, `Rmul_two_eq`). Root witness extended with `riemannIntegral_recip` and
  `tentPoleB_eq`. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`; RH open.
- **`clampedInv` — the clamped-reciprocal gadget: the totalized `1/x` integrand** (new
  `Analysis/ClampedInv.lean`; Sonine route, the recorded next brick after `tentPoleA_eq`):
  `clampedInv a x := 1/max(x, a)` (rational floor `a > 0`) is a genuine TOTAL function of `x`
  carrying exactly the certified-integration gateway's data — congruence (`clampedInv_congr`),
  the globally-Lipschitz bound with the RATIONAL constant `(1/a)²` (`clampedInv_lipschitz`),
  non-negativity, inertness `≈ 1/x` on `[a, ∞)` (`clampedInv_eq_of_ge`), and seq-exact rational
  evaluation `clampedInv a (ofQ q) ≈ ofQ (1/q)` for `q ≥ a` (`clampedInv_ofQ`, via the new
  `Rinv_ofQ`). The design resolves `Rinv`'s witness-as-data obstruction to totality: the
  per-index clamp `qClampQ a x` (seq `n ↦ max(xₙ, a)`, the floor-`a` generalization of
  `qClampOne`; `1`-Lipschitz via `Qmax_const_lip`, inert on `[a,∞)`) keeps the argument `≥ a`
  at EVERY index, so ONE witness (`k = 2·a.den`, `Qbound_lt_pos`) serves every `x`
  (`qClampQ_witness`). The reciprocal side is fully algebraic over the `Rinv` laws — no
  per-index reasoning about `Rmul`'s reindex: the Real-level difference identity
  `1/u − 1/v ≈ (v−u)·((1/u)·(1/v))` (`Rinv_sub_Rinv`), the floor cap `1/u ≤ 1/a`
  (`Rinv_le_ofQ_inv`), and the two-leg absolute assembly (`Rinv_abs_lipschitz`, the
  `Rlog_abs_lipschitz` pattern). Plus `lip_mono` (Lipschitz-modulus upgrade, for aligning
  the shared `L` that `riemannIntegral_add` requires) and `Qlt_of_Qlt_Qle`. With this,
  partial fractions reduce every remaining tent-slot integrand (`2 − 1/x`,
  `−(1 + 2/x − 4/(x+1))`, the shifted tail `−2/(u(u+2))`) to affine combinations the gateway
  integrates. Wired into the root witness (`F1Square.lean`): the `(1/a)²` Lipschitz datum at
  `a = 1/2` and the evaluation `clampedInv (1/2) 2 ≈ 1/2`. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`tentPoleA_eq` — THE FIRST EVALUATED WEIL-SLOT COMPONENT** (new
  `Analysis/AffineIntegral.lean`; Sonine route, step 2 boundary moving): the tent test
  (piecewise-linear, knots `1/2, 1, 2` — the `X = 2` prime-free window, all prime-side
  evaluations vanishing) has its `∫₀^∞ f(x) dx` pole part CONSTRUCTED as certified interval
  integrals AND evaluated in the kernel:
  `∫_{1/2}^{1} (2x−1) dx + ∫_{1}^{2} (2−x) dx ≈ 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4` (`tent_piece1`/`tent_piece2`/
  `tentPoleA_eq`) — a `WeilSlot` interface integral reduced, not carried as data. Built on the
  new affine evaluation layer: `lip_const`/`lip_scaled`/`lip_affine` (Lipschitz data for any
  modulus dominating the slope), `riemannIntegral_scaled` (`∫₀¹ q·x = q/2`),
  `riemannIntegral_affine` (`∫₀¹ (α + qx) = α + q/2`), `affine_pullback_eq` (the interval
  pullback of an affine map is affine), and the schedule-general `riemannIntegral_id_gen`
  (the value `1/2` for EVERY valid Lipschitz datum — the L-irrelevance the `smul` route
  needs). RECORDED for the next brick: the tent's remaining components (`f̃(0) = log 2`, the
  archimedean tail `−1 − 6log2 + 3log3`) have rational-function integrands
  (`2 − 1/x`, `−(x²−x+2)/(x(x+1))`, `−2/(x²−1)` past support — the PV singularity cancels
  exactly against the `f(1)`-subtraction); their construction needs a globally-Lipschitz
  clamped-reciprocal gadget over `Rinv` (the `RmaxZero` clamp keeps the argument `≥ a > 0`
  pointwise, so the `Rinv` witness is uniform). Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`riemannIntegral_id` — `∫₀¹ x dx ≈ 1/2`, the first NON-CONSTANT certified integral
  evaluation, and `Rlim_eval`, the limit-evaluation engine** (new `Analysis/IntegralEval.lean`;
  Sonine route, step 1): the Weil pairing's interface fields are integrals whose
  piecewise-polynomial closed forms are "routine but unverified in print" (`Weil.lean`) —
  reducing them in the kernel bottoms out in evaluating the gateway's integrals on explicit
  integrands, and the gateway had only `riemannIntegral_const`. Now built: `Rlim_eval` (a
  Bishop limit whose terms sit within `1/(j+1)` of a rational `c` IS `ofQ c` — proof at the
  diagonal, where the rate hypothesis at index `m = 2n+1` lands the `Radd`-inflated sample
  exactly on the limit's `4n+3` approximant), the `ℚ`-level Gauss fold `sumIota`,
  `riemannSum_id` (`R_N(id) = N/(2(N+1))`), `genSum_id_eval`/`genSum_id_rate` (the telescoped
  dyadic sums sit within `1/(2·2^M)` of `1/2`), and the evaluation itself. With the existing
  `_const`/`_add`/`_smul`/`_neg` linear API, every piecewise-LINEAR integrand now evaluates in
  closed form over rational intervals — the stratum the tent-window Weil tests live in; the
  realized `WeilSlot` (tent test, `X = 2`, prime-free window) is the recorded next brick.
  Mechanization note: a flipped `Req_symm` on an `Rneg_ofQ` congruence sent the unifier into
  structure-eta defeq on symbolic-`2^M` rationals (a `whnf` timeout) — congruence direction
  matters even between defeq-close terms. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`Rlambda3_lt_Rlambda4` — `λ₃ < λ₄`, the Li head certified strictly increasing through
  `n = 4`, and `convexClass3_pruned` — THE FIRST KILL AT ORDER 3** (new
  `Analysis/LambdaFourThreeGap.lean`): `λ₄ − λ₃ ≥ 0.035` (true `0.178`). The route is the
  DIFFERENCE, not the endpoints: bounding `λ₄` below and `λ₃` above separately fails
  (`0.2185 < 0.2486`) because each `ηⱼ` bracket width is then paid twice, and at binomial
  weights `3..6` that doubling swamps the true gap. The archimedean sides ARE cheap separately
  (cost `≈ 0.008`, since the constant `1` cancels exactly and the `ζ` weights are small), so only
  the arithmetic side needs an identity — `lambda4_arith_split`:
  `λ₄^{arith} − λ₃^{arith} = −(η₀ + 3η₁ + 3η₂ + η₃)`, obtained from the `nsmulR` splits
  (`nsmulR6_split`, `nsmulR4_split_left`) plus ONE 7-atom `RsumL` rearrangement whose
  permutation is built STRUCTURALLY from `List.Perm.swap`/`cons`/`trans` (`decide` on
  `List.Perm` is barred — it pulls `Classical.choice`). Two supporting brackets: the TIGHT
  `reta3_le_t` (`η₃ ≤ 0.0462725`, on `γ₃ ≤ 1/40` and `γ₂ ≤ −0.003`; the stock `reta3_le`'s
  `0.145303` rests on the loose `γ₃ ≤ 1/8` and is far too weak) and `genuineArchSeq4_ge_t`
  (`arch(4) ≥ −1.024325`, the `ζ(3) ≤ 1.205` sharpening of the stock `−1.066325`, which misses
  by `0.042`). `convexClass3_pruned` then kills the order-3 convex class — unreachable by the
  contraction lever, whose order-3 form is true by only `1.3%`, whereas the convex lever needs
  just `λ₃ < λ₄`, a `34%` margin. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **`convexClass12_pruned` / `convex_lamRec_fails` — the CONVEX-COMBINATION lever (sixth prune),
  general in the order** (`Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`): non-negative coefficients with
  `Σ aᵢ ≤ 1` cap `s K` by the maximum of the window (`convex_cap`, stated for arbitrary `K`), so
  a sequence strictly exceeding that maximum kills the class. Against the doubled Li sequence the
  numeric input is only `λ_K < λ_{K+1}` — certified at `K = 1, 2` by `Rlambda_head_increasing` —
  instead of the contraction lever's far heavier `λ_{K+1} > λ₁ + … + λ_K`. Supporting substrate:
  `RsumN_mul_right`, `Rle_Rsub_zero_of_Rle`, `Rsub_double`/`Pos_Rsub_double` (a strict gap
  doubles). RECORDED for the next session: the `K = 3` instance is a one-liner once
  `Pos (λ₄ − λ₃)` is certified, and an exact rational check confirms
  **`λ₄ − λ₃ ≥ 0.047033` is already reachable from brackets IN STOCK** through the difference
  identity `λ₄ − λ₃ = γ − 3η₁ − 3η₂ − η₃ − ½(γ+log4π) + (9/4)ζ(2) − (21/8)ζ(3) + (15/16)ζ(4)`;
  the outstanding work is purely the additive-cancellation mechanization (a 7-atom `RsumL`
  rearrangement after `nsmulR` splitting — note `decide` on `List.Perm` is barred, it pulls
  `Classical.choice`). Bounding `λ₄` and `λ₃` separately does NOT suffice (`0.2185 < 0.2486`):
  it pays each `η` bracket width twice, which is exactly what the difference avoids.
- **`gateA_prune_ledger` — the Gate-A prune ledger as one kernel-checked statement, plus two
  new order-uniform kills** (`Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`):
  - **`nonPositiveClass_pruned` (fifth prune, uniform in the order)**: no Gate-A finite list has
    ALL coefficients `≤ 0`, at EVERY order `K = 1..4` — for every η₄-anchored η-data, rule, and
    dimension. Unlike the contraction prunes this needs NO numerics: a combination of
    non-negative terms with non-positive coefficients is non-positive (`RsumN_nonpos`), while
    every doubled Li value in reach is strictly positive. The general core
    (`nonPositive_lamRec_fails`) is stated for arbitrary `K`; the `K ≤ 4` ceiling is exactly the
    reach of the certified `Pos λₙ` rungs, so each future rung widens this prune by one order
    for free.
  - **`orderZeroClass_pruned`**: the degenerate order `K = 0` is dead for free (the empty
    recurrence forces `2λₙ ≈ 0`, refuted by `Pos λ₁`).
  - **`gateA_prune_ledger`** bundles all four killed classes and records the surviving space:
    order `2` with an expanding coefficient, orders `3, 4` with some positive coefficient, and
    every order `K ≥ 5`.
  - RECORDED BOUNDARY (so the route is not re-attempted): the contraction lever
    `λ_{K+1} > λ₁ + … + λ_K` is TRUE at `K = 1, 2`, true-but-razor-thin at `K = 3`
    (`0.3858` vs `0.3230`, needing the `λ₄` lower to ~1% of truth), and **FALSE from `K = 4`**
    (`λ₅ ≈ 0.518 < λ₁+λ₂+λ₃+λ₄ ≈ 0.7088`) — mathematically exhausted, not under-certified.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **`Rlambda_head_increasing` — the certified Li head is STRICTLY INCREASING** (`λ₁ < λ₂ < λ₃`,
  `Analysis/LambdaTwoThreePrecision.lean`): `Rlambda1_lt_Rlambda2` (gap `≥ 0.05589`) and
  `Rlambda2_lt_Rlambda3` (gap `≥ 0.042`), from the now-disjoint brackets. Sharpens
  `Rlambda1_ne_Rlambda2` from *distinct* to *ordered*, and is the shape the cheaper
  convex-combination prune consumes (`Σaᵢ = 1, aᵢ ≥ 0` forces `λ_{K+1} ≤ λ_K`); extending it to
  `λ₃ < λ₄` needs a `λ₄` lower above `0.2554` — blocked on the `γ₁` bracket, whose 12%-wide
  spread dominates the `η₁` slack at coefficient `6`.
- **`Rlambda4_le` — the `λ₄` UPPER bracket (`λ₄ ≤ 0.563`), the fourth two-sided Li
  coefficient** (new `Analysis/LambdaFourUpper.lean`): `λ₄^{arith} = −(4η₀+6η₁+4η₂+η₃) ≤
  1.5458115` via the `η₃` floor `η₃ ≥ −0.0313379`, which needed four product LOWER bounds —
  each the `ge`-mirror of a stock upper: `Rgamma_pow4_ge` (`γ⁴ ≥ 0.577⁴`),
  `Rgamma_sq_gamma1_ge` (`γ²γ₁ ≥ 0.578²·(−0.0762)`, mixed sign), `Rgamma1_sq_ge`
  (`γ₁² ≥ 0.0677²`, via the double-negation square identity), `Rgamma_gamma2_ge`
  (`γγ₂ ≥ 0.578·(−0.014)`); and `arch(4) = 1 − 2(γ+log4π) + (9/2)ζ(2) − (7/2)ζ(3) +
  (15/16)ζ(4) ≤ −0.9828225` (`genuineArchSeq4_le`, the third `log 4π`-lower consumer). True
  value `λ₄ ≈ 0.385812`. The `λ₅` upper — the last 3×3-Hankel ingredient for the order-2
  expansion kill — runs through the unbuilt `γ₄` upper, the next numeric campaign.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **`contractionClass2_pruned` — the order-2 CONTRACTION class is dead (fourth prune)**
  (`Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`): no Gate-A finite list exists at order 2 with BOTH
  coefficients `≤ 1` (any reals), for every η₂-anchored η-data, rule, and dimension — the
  recurrence forces `2λ₃ ≈ a₀·2λ₁ + a₁·2λ₂ ≤ 2λ₁ + 2λ₂ ≤ 0.25082`, refuted by
  `2λ₃ ≥ 0.2872` (witness `n = 100`). Contains the canonical shift class `(0, 1)`
  (period-one-from-`n = 2` diagonals). The doubled Li sequence certifiably outruns any
  sub-unit combination of its two predecessors: `λ₁ + λ₂ ≤ 0.12541 < 0.1436 ≤ λ₃`.
  Surviving order-2 candidates need a coefficient `> 1`; their kill (the 3×3 Hankel
  determinant on `λ₁..λ₅`) needs `λ₄, λ₅` uppers — the `γ₄`-upper campaign. Axiom-clean;
  crux fields `none`.
- **`Rlambda2_le` / `Rlambda3_ge` — the third two-sided Li coefficient and the tightened `λ₃`
  lower** (new `Analysis/LambdaTwoThreePrecision.lean`): `λ₂ ≤ 1016/10⁴` (true `0.0923457`;
  the `log 4π`-lower consumer, joining `Rlambda2_pos`/`Rlambda2_ge` — λ₂ two-sided), and
  `λ₃ ≥ 1436/10⁴` (true `0.207639`; the stock positivity lower was `0.0584`): arithmetic side
  tightened to `λ₃^{arith} ≥ 1.173914` (`Rlambda3_arith_ge_t`, via `reta1_le4`,
  `Rgamma_cube_ge`, the sharp `Rgamma_gamma1_ge`, `Rgamma2_ge_neg0014`), archimedean side
  reused (`archLoR_le`). Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`order1Class_pruned` — the ENTIRE order-1 candidate family is dead (third prune)**
  (`Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`): for every η-data anchored through `η₂` (`StieltjesEta3`),
  every atlas rule, every dimension, and EVERY real coefficient `c`, no Gate-A finite list of
  order 1 exists. The two one-step relations at `n = 0, 1` force the coefficient-free product
  identity `(2λ₂)² ≈ (2λ₃)(2λ₁)` (associativity/commutativity eliminate `c`), and the certified
  brackets refute it outright: `(2λ₂)² ≥ 0.1594² = 0.02540836 > 0.02432430 ≥ 0.5108·0.04762 ≥
  (2λ₃)(2λ₁)` (via `Rlambda2_ge`, `Rlambda3_le`, `Rlambda1_le`; refuted at witness index
  `n = 2000` through the new `not_Rle_ofQ_of_witness`). Subsumes both earlier order-1 prunes on
  η₂-anchored data, and records the structural law: order-K classes consume the first K+1 λ's
  (anchors through `η_K`). The surviving Gate-A candidate frontier is order `K ≥ 2`.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **`Rlambda3_le` — the `λ₃` UPPER bracket (`λ₃ ≤ 0.2554`), the second two-sided Li
  coefficient** (new `Analysis/LambdaThreeUpper.lean`): consumes the fresh `log 4π` lower
  (`arch(3) = 1 − (3/2)(γ+log4π) + (9/4)ζ(2) − (7/8)ζ(3) ≤ −1.008445`, `genuineArchSeq3_le`)
  and two forced sharp ingredients on the arithmetic side (`λ₃^{arith} = −(3η₀+3η₁+η₂) ≤
  1.2638249`, `Rlambda3_arith_le`): the MIXED-SIGN product upper `γγ₁ ≤ 0.577·(−0.0677) =
  −0.0390629` (`Rgamma_gamma1_le` — its negativity is load-bearing; the two-sided abs bound
  `|γγ₁| ≤ 0.044` overshoots the kill budget by 0.25) and the tight `γ₂ ≤ −3/1000`
  (`Rgamma2_le_neg0003`, v0.22). Plus `Rgamma_cube_le` (`γ³ ≤ 0.578³`) and the named
  `Rlambda2_ge` (`λ₂ ≥ 0.0797`, from the LambdaGap atoms). True values: `λ₃ ≈ 0.207639`,
  `λ₂ ≈ 0.0923457`. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`contractionClass_pruned` — the SECOND candidate class killed: the entire contraction class**
  (`Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`): no Gate-A finite list exists with order 1 and ANY real
  coefficient `c ≤ 1`, for every anchored η-data, rule, and dimension — `lamRec` forces
  `2λ₂ ≈ c·2λ₁ ≤ 2λ₁` (via `satisfiesRec_order1_step`, `Pos λ₁`, and `Rmul` monotonicity),
  clashing with the certified gap through the new order-clash lemma `not_Pos_of_Rnonneg_Rneg`
  (`Pos z` and `Rnonneg (−z)` are contradictory at the approximant level) and
  `lambda_gap_pos_double` (`Pos (2λ₂ − (λ₁+λ₁))`, from `lambda_gap_pos` via
  `Rlambda1_double_eq`). Strictly generalizes `constantClass_pruned` (`c = 1`): the doubled Li
  sequence certifiably EXPANDS at its first step, so no non-expanding order-1 rule can carry the
  Gate-A diagonal. The surviving order-1 candidates are the strict expansions `c > 1`; their kill
  (`λ₃λ₁ vs λ₂²`) needs a `λ₃` upper — the next bracket. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`Rlog4pic_ge` — the `log 4π` LOWER bracket (`log 4π ≥ 2.53038`) and the first TWO-SIDED Li
  coefficient (`Rlambda1_le : λ₁ ≤ 0.02381`)** (new `Analysis/LogFourPiLower.lean`): the substrate
  carried only upper log brackets (built for the λ-positivity proofs) plus the crude `log π ≥ 1`;
  every λ UPPER bound — what the next Gate-A prunes consume — needs `log 4π` from below. Built:
  `artSum_le_base` (NEW substrate lemma — artanh partial sums are monotone in the base, via
  `qpow_le_base`), `Rpi_seq_ge_314` (every Machin approximant `≥ 3.14`, the depth-6 sharpening of
  `Rpi_seq_ge_three`: `arctan(1/5) ≥ 0.197354`, `arctan(1/239) ≤ 0.004226`, tail `(1/2)¹⁵`),
  `tmap_ge_314` (`q ≥ 3.14 ⟹ tmap q ≥ 107/207`, exactly `tmap(3.14)`), hence
  `RpiTmap ≥ 107/207` pointwise; then `log 2 ≥ 2·artSum(1/3,8) ≥ 0.69314` (`Rlog2c_ge_69314`) and
  `log π ≥ 2·artSum(107/207,5) ≥ 1.1441` (`Rlogpic_ge_11441`, base- then depth-monotonicity
  through the artanh diagonal), assembling to `log 4π ≥ 253038/10⁵` (true `2.531024`; upper
  companion `2.5316`). From it `2λ₁ ≤ 0.04762` (`Rtwolambda1_le`) and `λ₁ ≤ 2381/10⁵`
  (true `0.0230957`) — with `Rlambda1_pos` the first Li coefficient is bracketed two-sidedly.
  Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **`GateA_of_finiteList` — the Gate-A finite-list template (certificate front, workstream 2)**
  (new `Square/GateAFiniteList.lean`): Gate A specified as a finite exact hypothesis list around a
  generating recurrence, exactly as the certificate front prescribes — fix `D`, an order `K` and
  coefficients `a`, and require the `K` base identities `gramOf ι D (1+i) (1+i) ≈ 2λ_{1+i}`, the
  order-`K` recurrence on the embedding's squared-norm diagonal (`gramRec`), and the SAME
  recurrence on the doubled genuine Li sequence (`lamRec`) — bundled as `GateAList`. The reduction
  theorem `GateA_of_finiteList` proves the list implies `RealizesDiag` (hence, Gate B being free,
  `LiNonneg (genuineLamSeq)` — `finiteList_is_liNonneg`, the honest ledger: a satisfied list IS the
  crux content, and satisfiability is NEVER asserted). Engine: `linRec_unique` — two sequences
  under one order-`K` linear recurrence over the constructive reals with `≈`-equal initial window
  coincide (course-of-values induction, fully kernel-checked). Two-sided guards in the
  `GateA.lean` discipline: `finiteList_satisfiable` (at the template square the constant rule
  passes the WHOLE list and the reduction delivers `RealizesDiag` end to end) and
  `finiteList_can_fail` (the zero rule satisfies both recurrences yet its base identity is
  refuted — the base carries content). Every candidate `(ι, D, K, a)` is henceforth checked
  against this one list. Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **`constantClass_pruned` — the first candidate class killed through the template (workstream 1
  record)**: the order-1 constant class `(K, a) = (1, 1)` — every rule whose Gate-A diagonal is
  period-one from `n = 1` — is refuted for EVERY anchored η-data, every atlas rule `ι`, and every
  dimension `D` at once: its `lamRec` forces `2λ₂ ≈ 2λ₁` (`constantClass_lamRec_fails`, via
  `satisfiesRec_const_step` + `Rdouble_inj`), contradicting the certified gap. One finite
  certified fact kills the infinite class — the template doing its prune job.
- **`Rlambda1_ne_Rlambda2` — the first certified SEPARATION of two Li coefficients** (new
  `Analysis/LambdaGap.lean`): `2λ₂ − 2λ₁ ≥ 1130/10⁴ = 0.113` (`lambda_gap_lower`, true value
  `≈ 0.1385`), hence `Pos (2λ₂ − 2λ₁)` and `λ₁ ≉ λ₂`. The route dodges the missing `log 4π`
  LOWER bracket entirely: in `(λ₂ + λ₂) − Rtwolambda1` the `log 4π` atoms cancel
  ALGEBRAICALLY (one `RsumL_cancel_anywhere` pair in the `RAddNF` normalizer), and every
  surviving atom enters with the sign whose certified bracket already exists (`γ ≥ 0.577`,
  `γ² ≤ 0.578²`, `γ₁ ≤ −0.0677`, `log 4π ≤ 2.5316`, `ζ(2) ≥ 1.644`) — no new numerics. KEY
  mechanization gotcha, recorded for reuse: equating two differently-associated `RsumL`
  list spellings by defeq sends the unifier through transient comparisons of DIFFERENT `Real`
  atoms into the Bishop-reindexed `.seq` towers (observed 11 GB OOM); the fix is to bridge each
  `++`-spelling to the common cons literal by an ALIGNED `List`-level `rfl` and `rw` the
  composed equations into the goal — element comparisons stay syntactic (6 MB). Axiom-clean;
  crux fields `none`.
- **`coupling_n5_positive` — the `n = 5` prime–archimedean coupling is positive** (new
  `Square/CruxN5Closed.lean`): composes `coupling_n5_iff_pos_lambda5` (the reduction of the coupling's
  `n = 5` instance to the closed form `Rlambda5`) with `Rlambda5_pos`, conquering the `n = 5` coefficient
  of `atlas_crux_localization`'s `∀ n, coupling(n) > 0` — the first new rung beyond `n = 4`, matching the
  `coupling_head_positive` / `Rlambda2_pos` / `coupling_n3_positive` / `Rlambda4_pos` family. Does NOT close
  the crux (the uniform `∀ n`, = RH). Axiom-clean; crux fields `none`.
- **`Pos Rlambda5` — the fifth Li coefficient is positive** (new `Analysis/LambdaFivePos.lean`): the
  `n = 5` prime–archimedean coupling coefficient is conquered — the FIRST new rung beyond `n = 4`, and the
  first to carry `γ₄`. Certified `λ₅ ≥ 83316/10⁶ ≈ +0.0833` (true `λ₅ ≈ 0.518`), assembled from
  `Rlambda5_arith ≥ 1018316/10⁶ ≈ +1.0183` (the η-anchor uppers `reta1_le5`…`reta4_le5` on the TIGHT
  brackets of `LambdaFivePrecision`, via `Rlambda5_S_le`/`Rlambda5_arith_ge_r`) and
  `genuineArchSeq 5 ≥ −935000/10⁶ = −0.935` (`genuineArchSeq5_ge`: `arch(5) = 1 − (5/2)(γ+log4π) +
  (15/2)ζ(2) − (35/4)ζ(3) + (75/16)ζ(4) − (31/32)ζ(5)`, using the tightened `ζ(3) ≤ 1.205`). This required
  the full n=5 constant-precision campaign: `γ₄` was NOT the sole gate — the margin (−0.652 with the n≤4
  brackets) is dominated by `η₃`'s `choose(5,4) = ×5` amplification of the loose `γ₃ ≤ 1/8`, so the closure
  needed the tighter `γ₃ ≤ 1/40`, `γ₂ ∈ [−0.014, −0.003]`, `γ₁ ≤ −69/1000`, `ζ(3) ≤ 1.205` (STEP 1), then
  the direct η-by-η `λ₅^arith` lower bound + `arch(5)` lower bound + the `Pos` assembly (STEP 2-4, mirroring
  `LambdaFourPos`). Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free,
  no-smuggling audited; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **n=5 constant-precision brackets** (new `Analysis/LambdaFivePrecision.lean`, STEP 1 of the `Pos λ₅`
  closure): the tightened Stieltjes/ζ brackets the n=5 margin needs — `γ₃ ≤ 1/40` (`Rgamma3_le_1_40`),
  `γ₂ ≤ −3/1000` (`Rgamma2_le_neg0003`), `γ₂ ≥ −14/1000` (`Rgamma2_ge_neg0014`), `γ₁ ≤ −69/1000`
  (`Rgamma1_le_neg069`), `ζ(3) ≤ 1.205` (`zeta3_le_1205`) — each a one-degree-up-precision mirror of the
  existing bracket theorem at larger `N` and higher log-cap depth `T` (γ₃: T=21,N=650,j=500; γ₂/γ₁:
  T=12,N=600/256,j=400), with the large-N `decide` accumulators reduced under the lakefile `--tstack`
  and the correction-weakening lemmas (`corr_weaken500` etc.) handling the `2^1014`-scale middle terms
  via a raised `exponentiation.threshold`. WHY: the `Pos λ₅` margin (−0.652 with the n≤4 brackets) is
  dominated by `η₃`'s `choose 5 4 = ×5` amplification of the loose `γ₃ ≤ 1/8` — so n=5 needs these
  tighter constants (not `γ₄`, whose bracket contributes only ±0.04). With them the margin turns
  positive (+0.083). Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), no `sorry`/`native_decide`, no-smuggling
  audited; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **`Rgamma4_ge_neg02` — the certified `γ₄` LOWER bracket `γ₄ ≥ −1/5`** (new `Analysis/GammaFourLower.lean`):
  the numeric heart of the `n = 5` gate, completing the `decompForm4` ladder. The one-degree-up mirror of
  `GammaThreeLower`: rational partial-sum lower bound `lnQuartSumLo` (Σ(ln k)⁴/k), the `logBound⁵`/`logBound⁴`
  upper bounds for the subtracted `(1/5)(ln N)⁵` and `½(ln N)⁴/N` corrections, the five per-step LOWER
  part-bounds against `decompForm4` (`b4C2_ge ≥ 0`, `b3R3_ge ≥ −27/D`, `b2R2_ge4 ≥ −16/D`, `bR1_ge4 ≥ −2/D`,
  `R0_ge4 ≥ −1/D`, `D = p(p+1)`; via the polynomial-log caps `(ln p)²≤4p`/`(ln p)³≤27p`), telescoped to
  `sStep4 ≥ −46/(p(p+1))` and `γ₄ ≥ hSeq4(N) − 46/(N+1)` (`Rgamma4_ge_hSeq4`, via `Rgamma4 = Rlim g4SeqDyadic`),
  collapsed to the rational `gBound4lo` and closed by one big-integer kernel `decide` at `N = 245`. The target
  is the LOOSE `−1/5` (not `−1/20`): `γ₄` enters `λ₅` only through the small favourable `−(5/24)γ₄` term, so
  `−1/5` is amply sufficient for `Pos λ₅` while keeping the `decide` inside the default kernel stack (the tight
  `−1/20` would force N ≳ 830, past the C-stack ceiling). Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), no
  `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free, no-smuggling audited; crux fields `none`, RH open.
- **`sStep4_decomp` — the trapezoidal residual identity `sStep4 ≈ decompForm4`** (`Analysis/GammaFourBracket.lean`,
  the keystone of the `decompForm4` machinery): `decompForm4_eq_RsumL` / `lhsForm4_eq_RsumL` each expand to the
  same 11 canonical signed `RprodL` monomials (`b⁴C2`→3, `b³R3`→2, `b²R2`→2, `bR1`→2, `R0`→2), matched by
  `decomp_generic4` (the keystone `Req (lhsForm4 …) (decompForm4 …)`, via a kernel-verified 11-element
  `List.Perm` `[n2,n4,n6,n8,n10,n1,n3,n5,n7,n9,n11] ~ [n1..n11]`), and `sStep4_decomp` lands it at the log
  atoms (`a=ln(p+1)`, `b=ln p`, `u0=1/p`, `u1=1/(p+1)`) by rewriting the quintic difference
  `(ln(p+1))⁵−(ln p)⁵` through `quintic_diff_identity`. With this, the per-step trapezoidal residual `sStep4`
  is now an exact `b`-power decomposition — the bound-ready form the `γ₄` lower bracket telescopes. New
  degree-5/6 normalizers `Rmul_eq_RprodL6L`/`quart_times_pair`/`cube_times_triple`/`pair_times_sqpair`/
  `single_times_cubepair`. Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), no `sorry`/`native_decide`, no-smuggling audited.
- **`decompForm4` — the bound-ready trapezoidal residual decomposition** (`Analysis/GammaFourBracket.lean`,
  defs `lhsForm4`/`decompForm4` + theorems `partA4_eq`/`partC4_eq`): the third `decompForm4` brick, the
  degree-4 mirror of `decompForm3`. `lhsForm4 = ½a⁴u1 + ½b⁴u0 − (1/5)·δ·W₄` (the stage-1 residual after
  `quintic_diff_identity`) is grouped by powers of `b` into `decompForm4 = b⁴·C2 + b³·R3 + b²·R2 + b·R1 + R0`
  with `C2 = ½(u0+u1)−δ`, `R3 = 2δ(u1−δ)`, `R2 = δ²(3u1−2δ)`, `R1 = δ³(2u1−δ)`, `R0 = ½δ⁴u1 − (1/5)δ⁵`
  (`δ = a−b`) — the coefficients that will make `b²·R2 ≤ 0` drop and leave the clean-telescoping terms.
  `partA4_eq` expands `½a⁴u1` (via `quartic_binom`) and `partC4_eq` expands `(1/5)·δ·W₄` (via `W4_expand`),
  each into 5 canonical `RprodL` monomials, with the coefficient-collapse helpers `half_four`/`half_six`/
  `fifth_five`/`fifth_ten`. Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free,
  no-smuggling audited.
- **`W4_expand` — the quintic-factor expansion `W₄(b+δ, b)`** (`Analysis/GammaFourBracket.lean`,
  `a⁴+a³b+a²b²+ab³+b⁴ ≈ 5b⁴ + 10b³δ + 10b²δ² + 5bδ³ + δ⁴`, `δ = a−b`): the second `decompForm4` algebra
  brick — the `(a−b)·W₄` factor of the quintic difference `a⁵−b⁵` (`quintic_diff_identity`), with `a = b+δ`
  substituted. Built by the clean factoring `W₄ = a⁴ + (a³+a²b+ab²+b³)·b`, reusing `quartic_binom` for `a⁴`
  and the degree-3 `W_expand` for the inner cubic factor, then an aligned 5-term + 4-term collection
  (`W4_collect`) — flatten to one 9-element `RsumL`, a kernel-verified `List.Perm` to bring like terms
  adjacent, merge (new `one_plus_four`/`four_plus_one`/`four_plus_six`/`six_plus_four` coefficient lemmas,
  `Radd_eq_RsumL4`/`RsumL5` flatteners), reassociate to the left-nested target. Axiom-clean
  (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free, no-smuggling audited.
- **`quartic_binom` — the degree-4 binomial identity over the constructive reals** (`Analysis/GammaFourBracket.lean`,
  `(b+d)⁴ ≈ b⁴ + 4·b³d + 6·b²d² + 4·bd³ + d⁴`): the first reusable algebra brick of the `decompForm4`
  trapezoidal decomposition that the `γ₄` numeric bracket rests on (the sole remaining `n = 5` gate
  toward `Pos λ₅`). Built as a one-degree-up mirror of `cube_binom` — `cube_binom·(b+d)`, eight monomials
  normalized to canonical coefficient-first form via `Rmul_swap_last`/`Rmul_comm`/`Rmul_assoc`, collected
  through the `RsumL` append/permute machinery (a kernel-verified 8-element `List.Perm`), and merged with
  `three_plus_one`/`three_plus_three`/`one_plus_three`. Elaborates in ~1 s at the default heartbeat budget
  (the degree-4 explicit congruence is fast *when structurally exact*: any single mismatch triggers a
  `whnf` blow-up, since the `Real` ops are reducible structure defs — the diagnostic lesson of this brick).
  Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free, no-smuggling audited.
- **The fifth Li coefficient `λ₅` as a closed-form constructive object** (new `Analysis/LambdaFive.lean`
  + `Square/CruxFrontierN5.lean`, `Rlambda5`, `coupling_n5_iff_pos_lambda5`): the next rung of the
  genuine λ-ladder, the FIRST to carry `γ₄` (`Rgamma4`). The new η-anchor is **`η₄ = −γ⁵ − 5γ³γ₁ − 5γγ₁²
  − (5/2)γ²γ₂ − (5/2)γ₁γ₂ − (5/6)γγ₃ − (5/24)γ₄`**, derived from the `−ζ′/ζ` Laurent data via
  `ηⱼ = (j+1)gⱼ₊₁` (`−log F = Σ gⱼuʲ`, `F = (s−1)ζ`) — the same recursion that reproduces `η₀..η₃`
  exactly, and numerically confirmed (`η₄ ≈ −0.005539`, `λ₅^{arith} ≈ +1.45906`, `λ₅^{∞} ≈ −0.94094`,
  `λ₅ ≈ +0.51812`, the standard Li value). `λ₅^{arith} = −(5η₀+10η₁+10η₂+5η₃+η₄)` and the closed form
  meets the genuine ladder at `n = 5` (`genuineLam_five`), so the `n = 5` coupling conquest reduces
  exactly to `Pos Rlambda5` (`coupling_n5_iff_pos_lambda5`/`crux_frontier_n5`), mirroring `n = 4`. This
  builds the λ₅ OBJECT; it does NOT prove `Pos λ₅` (which awaits the `γ₄` numeric bracket + the
  multi-constant assembly). `γ₄` enters `λ₅` only via `η₄` with the tiny FAVOURABLE coefficient
  `+(5/24)γ₄ ≈ +0.0015`. Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), choice-free, no-smuggling audited; the
  crux fields stay `none`, RH open.

- **The fourth Stieltjes constant `γ₄` as a genuine constructive real** (new `Analysis/GammaFour.lean`,
  `Rgamma4 := Rlim g4SeqDyadic g4SeqDyadic_RReg`, `γ₄ ≈ +0.00722`): the arithmetic-side prerequisite for the
  `n = 5` coupling rung (`λ₅`), built as the full degree-5 mirror of `GammaThree`'s `γ₃`. The
  EM-accelerated defining sequence `g₄(j) = Σ_{k≤j+1}(ln k)⁴/k − (1/5)(ln(j+1))⁵`, whose per-step
  trapezoidal residual `e₄` is summable-enveloped `e₄ ∈ [−a⁴/(p(p+1)), 4a³/(p(p+1))]` (`a = ln(p+1)`),
  then dyadic-block-telescoped to a Bishop-regular sequence (`g4SeqDyadic_RReg`, reindex `M(j)=2j+22`)
  whose limit is `γ₄`. New degree-5 algebra: the **quintic factoring** `a⁵−b⁵ = (a−b)(a⁴+a³b+a²b²+ab³+b⁴)`
  (`quintic_diff_identity`, via the reusable `Rmul_swap_outer`/`Rmul_swap_last` monomial-reassociation
  helpers), the `W₄ ∈ [5b⁴, 5a⁴]` envelopes, and the degree-3/degree-4 discrete-antiderivative domination
  chains (`Q_U(m)=8m³+72m²+264m+408`, `Q_L(m)=2m⁴+24m³+132m²+408m+598`, each verified by `ring_uor` to
  satisfy `2Q_U(m)−Q_U(m+1)=8(m+2)³` / `2Q_L(m)−Q_L(m+1)=2(m+2)⁴`). The cubic/quartic infrastructure
  (`logCube`, `logQuartic`, `quartic_diff_identity`, `W3_le_4a3`, `Csum`, the block caps) is reused from
  `GammaThree`. With `γ`, `γ₁`, `γ₂`, `γ₃` (bracketed) and `ζ(5)`, this is the last unbuilt Stieltjes
  constant for the `η₄` Taylor data behind `λ₅`. Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), choice-free,
  no-smuggling audited; the crux fields stay `none`, RH open. The two-sided `γ₄` bracket + the `λ₅` rung
  are the remaining `n = 5` steps.

- **ζ-value brackets — `ζ(5) ∈ [1.036, 1.052]`** (`Analysis/ZetaTwo.lean`, `zeta5_lower`/`zeta5_upper`):
  the next ζ-constituent for the future `n = 5` coupling rung, mirroring the `ζ(4)` block (partial-sum
  lower `zetaSum_five_70_ge` and decreasing-upper `zetaU_five_70_le`, each one rational `decide` at
  `N = 70`, lifted through the generic `zeta_ge_partial`/`zeta_le_partial`). Just as `ζ(4)` feeds
  `Pos Rlambda4`, this is the `ζ(5)` prerequisite for a `Pos Rlambda5`. Axiom-clean, crux `none`.

- **Stieltjes brackets — the γ₃ LOWER bracket `γ₃ ≥ −1/20`, completing the two-sided `−1/20 ≤ γ₃ ≤ 1/8`**
  (new `Analysis/GammaThreeLower.lean`, `Rgamma3_ge_neg005`): the companion of `GammaThreeBracket`'s
  `Rgamma3_le` (`γ₃ ≤ 1/8`), filling the documented gap (`γ₃` had an upper bracket but "no lower bracket
  yet"). Same discrete Euler–Maclaurin construction as the other brackets — the accelerated sequence
  `hSeq3 j = g₃(j) − ½·(ln(j+1))³/(j+1)` whose per-step trapezoidal residual `sStep3` is now bounded
  *below* (`sStep3 ≥ −6/(p(p+1))`, `sStep3_lower_tele`) by mirroring the four-part decomposition
  `decompForm3 = b³C2 + b²R2 + b·R1 + R0` downward: `b³C2 ≥ 0`, `b²R2 ≥ −3/(p(p+1))` (via the square-cap
  `(ln p)² ≤ 4p`), `b·R1 ≥ −2/(p(p+1))`, `R0 ≥ −1/(p(p+1))` (via the new quartic self-bound `d⁴ ≤ 1/p⁴`).
  Telescoped to `γ₃ ≥ hSeq3(N) − 6/(N+1)` (`Rgamma3_ge_hSeq3`), then certified at `N = 199` with the
  LOWER-direction rational evaluators — the new cubed-log sum lower bound `lnCubeSumLo`/`lnCubeSum_ge`
  (`logLowBound` cubed, round-down) against the `logBound`-upper corrections `logQuartic_le`/
  `halfCubeOver_le` — collapsed to the single `gBound3lo` and one big-integer kernel `decide`
  (`gamma3_lo_decide`). This is the `γ₃` prerequisite for the future `λ₅` rung (the `η₄` Taylor data needs
  a two-sided `γ₃`). Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), choice-free, no-smuggling audited; the crux
  fields stay `none`, RH open.

- **Track 1 (item 0) — the LARGE-argument end of the arctangent range extension** (new
  `Analysis/RArctanExt.lean`, `RarctanExt` / `RarctanExt_value_eq` / `RarctanR_add_RarctanExt`): the
  constructive `arctan` at large argument `|t| ≥ 16`, via the complementary-angle reduction
  `arctan(1/s) = π/2 − arctan s`. `RarctanR s` (`RArctan.lean`) is defined only for `|s| ≤ ρ < 1/16`, so its
  reciprocal `1/s` (`≥ 16`) lies far outside the radius; `arctanExt s := π/2 − arctan s` supplies that value
  through the complementary angle — sidestepping the `1 − s·(1/s) = 0` singularity that blocks the
  tangent-addition route. The value identity `RarctanExt_value_eq` (`tan(arctanExt s) = 1/s`) composes the
  real-argument value identity `RarctanR_value_eq` (`RArctanValue.lean`) with the complementary-tangent
  formula `Rsin_cos_pi_half_sub_tan_real` (`TanPiQuarter.lean`) — the real-level form of the reduction
  `ComplexArgUpper.CargUpper_tan` already applies for the complex argument; the genuinely-new piece is the
  explicit *real* reflection identity `RarctanR_add_RarctanExt` (`arctan s + arctan(1/s) = π/2`).
  **Honest scope:** this closes only the large-argument end; the middle band `1/16 < |t| < 16` (where `1/t`
  is also outside `1/16`) remains the open part of the *full* range extension `Carg`/`Clog` need toward
  `log ξ` — closing it needs a larger value-identity radius or an addition-law stepping argument. Crux
  `none`. Axiom-clean, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6) — the Hadamard/`bl` witness sum in reciprocal-moment-order form**
  (`Analysis/MomentCayley.lean`, `hadamard_witnessSum_moment`): the item-6 object, assembled on the
  *genuine* zeros. For a `HadamardXi` enumeration of the nontrivial zeros, the `bl` witness sum over its
  `s = 1` factors equals `−Σ_{k=1}^{n} Re(M_k)` with `M_k = Σ_j C(n,k)(−1/ρⱼ)ᵏ` the order-`k` reciprocal
  moment over the reciprocals `1/ρⱼ`: `Σ_j (1 − Re((1 − 1/ρⱼ)ⁿ)) = −Σ_{k} Re(M_k)`. Chains
  `witnessSum_hadFactor_eq_liRatio` (Hadamard `s=1` factors = Cayley factors), the per-zero
  `liRatio_eq_one_sub_inv` lifted across the list (`witnessSum_mapidx_congr` + `List.map_map`), and the
  moment decomposition `witnessSum_moment_order` — `λₙ`'s zero-sum decomposed by moment order over the
  actual Hadamard zero enumeration. The remaining classical content (`Σ_ρ ρ^{−k}` as the `ζ`-data with its
  archimedean place; the `HadamardXi` convergence seam) is unchanged; crux `none`. Axiom-clean, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6) — the moment expansion lands on the genuine Cayley object** (new
  `Analysis/MomentCayley.lean`, `liRatio_witnessTerm_moment` / `liRatio_npow_moment` /
  `liRatio_eq_one_sub_inv`): the abstract binomial moment machinery (`ComplexBinomial.lean`, for any
  `w = 1 − u`) is instantiated at the *actual* Bombieri–Lagarias Cayley factor `liRatio ρ = 1 − 1/ρ`
  (`CayleyMap.lean`), with `u = 1/ρ = Cinv ρ`. `liRatio_eq_one_sub_inv` puts `liRatio ρ` in the exact
  `1 + (−u)` form (via `hadFactor_one_eq_liRatio` + `1·(1/ρ) ≈ 1/ρ`); then the per-zero witness term on
  the real object follows directly: `1 − Re((1 − 1/ρ)ⁿ) = −Re(Σ_{k=1}^{n} C(n,k)(−1/ρ)ᵏ)` — the per-zero
  summand of `RHWitness.witnessSum` over the explicit-formula reciprocal moments `(1/ρ)ᵏ`. Closes the
  loop: the whole moment-expansion arc is now consumed by the genuine Cayley/Li object behind `bl`, not an
  abstract `w`. The remaining classical content (`Σ_ρ ρ^{−k}` as the `ζ`-data with its archimedean place)
  is unchanged; crux `none`. Axiom-clean, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6) — the two Li-term linearizations agree `reciprocalMomentPoly_eq_neg_u_cgeomSum`**
  (`Analysis/ComplexBinomial.lean`): the binomial reciprocal-moment polynomial equals `−u` times the
  geometric sum of `LiLinearize.lean`. For `w = 1 − u` (so `u = 1/ρ`), both `reciprocalMomentPoly u n`
  (`Σ_{k=1}^{n} C(n,k)(−u)ᵏ`, from the binomial) and `−u·Σ_{k<n} wᵏ` (`cone_sub_npow_factor`) are exactly
  `wⁿ − 1`, hence equal: `reciprocalMomentPoly u n ≈ −(u·Σ_{k<n} wᵏ)`. Pins the new binomial-moment
  representation to the pre-existing geometric one — no representation drift between `ComplexBinomial.lean`
  and `LiLinearize.lean`, the same per-zero Li contribution in two algebraic forms. Pure algebra,
  axiom-clean, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6) — moment-side closure `momentListPoly_append` / `momentListPoly_snoc`**
  (`Analysis/ComplexBinomial.lean`): the summed reciprocal-moment polynomial is additive over
  concatenation of the zero list (`momentListPoly (l₁++l₂) n = momentListPoly l₁ n + momentListPoly l₂ n`,
  pure `Cadd_assoc` fold), with the `snoc` increment. The moment-side analogues of the proven
  `witnessSum_append`/`_snoc`: splitting the zero enumeration (the incremental `bl` partial sums
  `List.range M`, or the conjugate-pair grouping `{ρ, 1−ρ, ρ̄, 1−ρ̄}`) splits the moment sum. Pure algebra,
  axiom-clean, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6) — a structural shape-match `witnessSum_eq_genuineArith`** (new
  `Analysis/MomentEta.lean`): the constructive moment-expansion form of a finite witness sum
  (`witnessSum_moment_order`, `ComplexBinomial.lean`) and the constructive arithmetic `η`-form
  (`genuineArithSeq`, `GenuineLi.lean`) carry the *same* binomial-weighted shape (`−Σ_k` of
  `C(n,k)`-weighted terms), so they are equal term-by-term under one per-order coefficient hypothesis
  `Re(M_k) = C(n,k)·η_{k−1}` (`seam`, an explicit audit-visible hypothesis, never an axiom, never
  discharged): `Σ_w (1 − Re(wⁿ)) = −Σ_{j=1}^{n} C(n,j)·η_{j−1}` (clean induction `moment_re_eq_arithTail`,
  matching the `(CsumN …).re`/`arithTail` recursions). **Honesty scope:** this is a shape-level identity
  between two constructed representations, **not** a discharge or relocation of `bl`. `genuineArithSeq` is
  only the *arithmetic* piece of `λₙ` (`λₙ = genuineArithSeq + genuineArchSeq`; `λ₁^{arith} = γ ≈ 0.577`
  vs the full `λ₁ ≈ 0.023`), while the genuine Bombieri–Lagarias zero-sum limit equals the *full* `λₙ`; and
  the true explicit formula relates the zero moments to the `−ζ′/ζ` data **plus** the archimedean place,
  which the per-order `seam` omits. So the `seam` is not asserted for the genuine zeros, and `bl` is not
  shrunk — closing it constructively (explicit formula + archimedean term + Hadamard convergence) remains
  the open Track-1 work. Crux fields `none`; RH open. Axiom-clean, no-smuggling audited, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6) — `λₙ` decomposed by reciprocal-moment order** (`Analysis/ComplexBinomial.lean`,
  `witnessSum_moment_order`, `momentListPoly_swap`, `momentList`): the Fubini interchange of the sum over
  zeros with the sum over orders. `momentListPoly_swap` swaps `Σ_{u∈us} Σ_{k=1}^{n} C(n,k)·(−u)ᵏ ≈
  Σ_{k=1}^{n} Σ_{u∈us} C(n,k)·(−u)ᵏ` (list induction, `CsumN_add` regrouping). Combined with
  `witnessSum_eq_neg_momentList`, `witnessSum_moment_order` gives `λₙ`'s zero-sum (`bl`) as
  `Σ_w (1 − Re(wⁿ)) = −Σ_{k=1}^{n} Re(M_k)` with `M_k = Σ_{u∈us} C(n,k)·(−u)ᵏ` the order-`k` reciprocal
  moment — `λₙ`'s explicit decomposition into the per-order moments `Σ_ρ ρ^{−k}`. This is the structural
  endpoint of the constructive moment expansion: the sole remaining classical input is the per-order
  identity of each `M_k` with the `−ζ′/ζ` Taylor data (the single labelled `bl` seam), reduced from a
  monolithic limit to one clean identity per order. Axiom-clean, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6) — the witness sum in reciprocal-moment form** (`Analysis/ComplexBinomial.lean`,
  `witnessSum_eq_neg_momentList`, `momentListPoly`): the per-zero `witnessTerm_moment` summed over the
  zero list. Over the Cayley factors `w = 1 − u` of a moment list `us = {1/ρ}`, the Li witness sum
  `Σ_w (1 − Re(wⁿ))` equals `−Re(Σ_{u∈us} Σ_{k=1}^{n} C(n,k)·(−u)ᵏ)` — `λₙ`'s zero-sum (`bl`) written
  entirely over the explicit-formula reciprocal moments `(1/ρ)ᵏ`. With the order-`k` moment
  `M_k = Σ_ρ Re(ρ^{−k})` factored out, `λₙ = Σ_{k=1}^{n} (−1)^{k+1} C(n,k)·M_k`, leaving the sole classical
  seam as the per-order identity `M_k = η`-data (`−ζ′/ζ` Taylor coefficients). Clean list induction
  (`Rneg_Radd` regrouping), axiom-clean, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6) — the per-zero witness term in reciprocal-moment form** (`Analysis/ComplexBinomial.lean`,
  `witnessTerm_moment` / `Cnpow_one_sub_momentPoly`, `reciprocalMomentPoly`): the forced consumer of the
  complex binomial. For `w = 1 − u` the per-zero Li witness term `1 − Re(wⁿ)` equals `−Re(Σ_{k=1}^{n}
  C(n,k)·(−u)ᵏ)` — the binomial expansion of `wⁿ` with the leading `1` cancelling the outer `1` (front-split
  via `CsumN_shift` + `binTermC_zero`), leaving exactly the negated reciprocal-moment polynomial. With
  `u = 1/ρ` this is the per-zero summand of `witnessSum` (`RHWitness.lean`) written over the explicit-formula
  moments `(1/ρ)ᵏ`; summing over the zeros and interchanging the two finite sums gives `λₙ` as
  `Σ_{k=1}^{n} (−1)^{k+1} C(n,k)·M_k` with `M_k = Σ_ρ Re(ρ^{−k})` the order-`k` reciprocal moment — isolating
  the single classical seam `M_k = η`-data. Axiom-clean, grep-novel.

- **Track 1 (item 6, pure algebra) — the binomial theorem over the constructive `Complex` API**
  `(1 + b)ⁿ ≈ Σ_{k=0}^{n} C(n,k)·bᵏ` (`Cnpow_one_add_eq`, new `Analysis/ComplexBinomial.lean`), and its
  Cayley-factor consequence `Cnpow_one_sub_eq`: `w = 1 − u ⟹ wⁿ ≈ Σ_k C(n,k)·(−u)ᵏ`. For the
  Bombieri–Lagarias factor `w = 1 − 1/ρ` the moment is `u = 1/ρ`, so this writes each per-zero power
  `(1 − 1/ρ)ⁿ` over the explicit-formula **reciprocal moments** `(1/ρ)ᵏ = Σ_ρ ρ^{−k}` — the binomial
  expansion applied to exactly the object the `bl` witness sum `Σ_w (1 − Re(wⁿ))` is built from,
  extending the `witnessSum_eq_linear` moment-factoring line one step further (full moment polynomial,
  not just the single `1/ρ`). The remaining classical content (moments `Σ_ρ ρ^{−k}` as the `η`-polynomial)
  stays the single labelled seam; crux fields `none`. Built choice-free with nat-scalar `Cnsmul` (so
  Pascal's rule `C(n+1,k)=C(n,k)+C(n,k−1)` is the clean complex additivity `Cnsmul_add`, no `ofReal`
  embedding of coefficients), plus the supporting `Cmul_Cnsmul`, `Cmul_CsumN` (mult over finite sum),
  `CsumN_congr_le` (bounded congruence), and the subtraction-free index shift `CsumN_shift`. Grep-verified
  novel (the existing `Binomial.lean` is the ℚ binomial; this is the genuinely-complex one), axiom-clean.

- **Track 1 (`bl` witness) — partial-sum telescoping `witnessSum_append`/`witnessSum_snoc`** (`Analysis/RHWitness.lean`):
  the Li/zero-sum witness `Σ_w (1 − Re(wⁿ))` is additive over concatenation of the zero list
  (`witnessSum (l₁++l₂) = witnessSum l₁ + witnessSum l₂`, pure `Radd_assoc` fold), with the `snoc`
  increment `witnessSum (l ++ [w]) = witnessSum l + (1 − Re(wⁿ))`. This is the analogue, on the
  explicit-formula/`bl` side, of the integral's additive linearity, and the exact shape of the `bl`
  partial sums `witnessSum ((List.range M).map zeroCayley) n` as `M` grows by one — the increment the
  convergence seam `reg` is stated over. Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.

- **Track 2 (integration) — scalar linearity lifted up the full Mellin stack** (`Analysis/IntervalIntegral.lean`,
  `Analysis/ImproperIntegral.lean`, `Analysis/ComplexIntegral.lean`): `riemannIntegralI_smul`
  (interval `∫ₐ^{a+w}`, left-commuting `q` past the width `w`), `integralTerm_smul`, `improperIntegral1_smul`
  (the half-line tail, via `Rlim_ofQ_mul_of_approx` directly), `halfLineIntegral_smul` (`∫₀^∞ (q·f)=q·∫₀^∞ f`),
  and `ChalfLineIntegral_smul` (complex Mellin, componentwise, real-rational scalar → explicit pair
  `⟨q·∫gr, q·∫gi⟩`). **With `_add` and `_neg` at every layer, the constructive integral — through the complex
  Mellin domain — is now a full real-rational-linear functional**, the form the Weil pairing's real test
  coefficients act through. The re/im-mixing complex `Cmul` scalar remains the one deferred (downstream) case.
- **Track 2 (integration) — scalar linearity `riemannIntegral_smul` (`∫(q·f)=q·∫f`)** via
  `Rlim_ofQ_mul_of_approx` (`Analysis/RlimProps.lean`, `Analysis/RiemannSum.lean`,
  `Analysis/DyadicIntegral.lean`): the scalar half of integral linearity — with `_add`/`_neg`, the
  full **linear-functional** structure of the certified integral (`∫(α·f + β·g) = α·∫f + β·∫g` for
  rational `α,β`). `Rlim_ofQ_mul` is generalized to `Rlim_ofQ_mul_of_approx` (`W ≈ q·X` pointwise, `W`'s
  regularity given — one `happ`-triangle over the core, exactly the `Rlim_add → Rlim_add_of_approx`
  move, since `RReg(q·X)` is not derivable when `|q|>1`). The finite chain: new `RsumN_Rmul_const`,
  `riemannSum_smul`, `genSum_Rmul_of_termwise`, `Rmul_Rsub_distrib_loc` — dyadic sums scale at every
  level — then `Rlim_ofQ_mul_of_approx` + `Rmul_distrib` carry the scalar through the limit (shared
  Lipschitz `L`, so the reindexes align). Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 (limit substrate) — scalar-multiple limit `Rlim_ofQ_mul`** (`Analysis/RlimProps.lean`):
  `lim (q·X) = q·lim X` for a constant `q : ℚ` — the scalar half of limit linearity, and the genuinely
  hard one. `Rmul`'s reindex `Ridx q y n = 2·RmulK(q,y)·(n+1)−1` is magnitude-dependent (varies across
  the meta-sequence), so `Rlim_add`'s clean `8n+7` alignment does not port. The UOR insight that makes it
  tractable: **`q` is a CONSTANT**, so its sequence is invariant and the `Qabs_mul_diff` cross term
  vanishes, leaving only `|q|·|X-difference|`; and `RmulK ≥ 1` forces every reindex `≥ 8(n+1)`, so each
  regularity term is `≤ const/(n+1)` *regardless* of the (varying) magnitude bound. `Req_of_lin_bound`
  absorbs the `|q|` constant (`C = |q.num|`). The substrate for the scalar half of integral linearity
  (`∫(q·f) = q·∫f`). Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 2 (integration) — complex integral congruence `Cintegral_congr` / `ChalfLineIntegral_congr`**
  (`Analysis/ComplexIntegral.lean`): `∫ z ≈ ∫ z'` when the real/imaginary integrand parts agree pointwise,
  for the complex line integral `∫_a^{a+w}` and the complex Mellin integral `∫₀^∞` — componentwise from
  the real `riemannIntegralI_congr`/`halfLineIntegral_congr`. The integrand-congruence the Weil/theta
  complex-integrand rewrites need; completes the complex integral's `_congr` alongside `_add`/`_neg`.
  Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 2 (integration) — integral negation up the full stack `halfLineIntegral_neg` / `ChalfLineIntegral_neg`**
  (`Analysis/IntervalIntegral.lean`, `Analysis/ImproperIntegral.lean`, `Analysis/ComplexIntegral.lean`):
  `∫(−f) = −∫f` lifted from the base through `riemannIntegralI_neg` (interval, affine + `Rmul_neg_right`)
  → `integralTerm_neg` → `improperIntegral1_neg` (`∫₁^∞`, `genSum_Rneg_of_termwise` + `Rlim_neg` via the
  now-public `RReg_Rneg`) → `halfLineIntegral_neg` (`∫₀^∞`) → `ChalfLineIntegral_neg` (complex Mellin,
  componentwise). **With the `_add` chain this completes the full additive-GROUP linearity of the entire
  integral stack** (real + complex Mellin: `∫(f−g)=∫f−∫g`), the substrate the signed Weil functional
  `poles − primes − arch` needs. Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 2 (integration) — integral negation `riemannIntegral_neg` (base)** (`Analysis/RiemannSum.lean`,
  `Analysis/DyadicIntegral.lean`): `∫₀¹ (−f) = −∫₀¹ f`, the `−1`-scalar case completing (with
  `riemannIntegral_add`) the additive-GROUP linearity of the base integral (`∫(f−g)=∫f−∫g`, for the
  signed Weil functional). The dyadic sums negate at every finite level — new primitives `RsumN_Rneg`
  (`Σ(−F)=−ΣF`), `riemannSum_neg`, `genSum_Rneg_of_termwise` — and `Rlim_neg` (with `RReg_neg`, inlined
  locally) carries it through the limit; `dyadicTerm` negation via `Rsub_Rneg_Rneg`. Modulus-safe
  (negation doesn't inflate the index). Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 2 (integration) — base-integral congruence `riemannIntegral_congr` / `riemannIntegralI_congr`**
  (`Analysis/DyadicIntegral.lean`, `Analysis/IntervalIntegral.lean`): `∫f ≈ ∫g` for `f ≈ g` pointwise on
  `[0,1]` and `[a,a+w]` — the integral respects `≈` of the integrand, completing the `_congr` family
  (the improper/half-line congruences already existed; the two base integrals were the gap). Each is
  `Rle_antisymm` of the corresponding `_le` both ways. Axiom-clean. (The integrand-congruence substrate
  any future integral rewrite — including a negation/subtraction zero-trick — needs.)
- **Track 2 (integration) — complex Mellin integral linearity `ChalfLineIntegral_add`** (additive part)
  (`Analysis/ComplexIntegral.lean`): `∫₀^∞ ((gfr+ggr) + i(gfi+ggi)) = ∫₀^∞(gfr+i·gfi) + ∫₀^∞(ggr+i·ggi)`
  — the additive half of linearity for the constructive **complex** Mellin integral, the object the
  windowed Weil pairing and the Mellin transform of the theta relation (item 3) inhabit. Componentwise
  from the real `halfLineIntegral_add` (real and imaginary parts, each at its own shared Lipschitz
  constant `Lr`/`Li` and decay rate `Kr`/`Ki`). Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 2 (integration) — half-line/Mellin integral linearity `halfLineIntegral_add`** (additive part)
  (`Analysis/IntervalIntegral.lean`, `Analysis/ImproperIntegral.lean`): `∫₀^∞ (f+g) = ∫₀^∞ f + ∫₀^∞ g`,
  the substrate the Weil/theta Mellin integrals live on (Track-2 step 2), lifted up the integral stack
  from `riemannIntegral_add`: `riemannIntegralI_add` (interval `[a,a+w]`, via the affine rescaling +
  `Rmul_distrib`) → `integralTerm_add` (the unit tail increment) → `improperIntegral1_add`
  (`∫₁^∞`, the tail increments add ⟹ partials add via `genSum_Radd_of_termwise`, then
  `Rlim_add_of_approx` joins the limits) → `halfLineIntegral_add` (`∫₀^∞ = ∫₀¹ + ∫₁^∞`, `Radd_swap`).
  All at a shared Lipschitz constant `L` so the dyadic reindexes align. Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 2 (integration) — Riemann-integral linearity `riemannIntegral_add`** (`Analysis/DyadicIntegral.lean`):
  `∫₀¹ (f+g) = ∫₀¹ f + ∫₀¹ g` — the additive half of linearity for the certified Bishop-limit integral,
  and the first genuine consumer of `Rlim_add_of_approx` (validating the limit-additivity layer end to
  end). The three integrals share a Lipschitz constant `L` (caller supplies `L ≥ L_f + L_g` with all
  three Lipschitz proofs at `L`), so they use the same dyadic reindex `digammaMidx L` and the limits
  align — no integral-`L`-independence lemma needed. The dyadic sums add at every finite level
  (`riemannSum_add` ⟹ `dyadicR` ⟹ `dyadicTerm` via `Rsub_Radd_Radd` ⟹ `genSum` via the new
  `genSum_Radd_of_termwise`), so the integral sequences satisfy `Z_{f+g} ≈ Z_f + Z_g` pointwise; the
  combined convergence is GIVEN (its own `dyadicSum_RReg`), so `Rlim_add_of_approx` joins the limits
  without a (non-derivable) combined regularity. Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 (item 6 — series substrate) — series additivity `Cseries_add`, via `Rlim_add_of_approx`**
  (`Analysis/RlimProps.lean`, `Analysis/ComplexLimit.lean`, `Analysis/ComplexSeries.lean`):
  `Σ_k (Fₖ + Gₖ) ≈ (Σ_k Fₖ) + (Σ_k Gₖ)` — linearity of the complex infinite sum, the forced tool for
  splitting a log-derivative / witness series into its component series (item 6). This had appeared
  *blocked* (the fixed `RReg` modulus is not preserved under summation, so a combined regularity is not
  derivable) — the unblock is the **generalization `Rlim_add_of_approx`** (`lim W ≈ lim X + lim Y` when
  `W ≈ X + Y` pointwise): it takes `W`'s regularity as GIVEN rather than deriving the sum's, so the
  caller's `CsumConv (F+G)` carries `W = CsumN (F+G)`, which is pointwise `≈ CsumN F + CsumN G` by
  `CsumN_add`. Proof of `Rlim_add_of_approx`: the `Rlim_add` `8n+7` diagonal alignment plus one triangle
  for the `happ` error (`2/(4n+4) + 10/(8n+8) = 14/(8n+8) ≤ 2/(n+1)`, still absorbed by
  `Req_of_lin_bound`); `Rlim_add` becomes its `happ = refl` corollary. `Clim_add_of_approx` is the
  componentwise lift; `Cseries_add` a 1-liner over it. Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 (item 5 — product substrate) — finite-product multiplicativity `CprodN_mul`**
  (`Analysis/ComplexSeries.lean`): `∏_{k<N} (Fₖ·Gₖ) ≈ (∏_{k<N} Fₖ)·(∏_{k<N} Gₖ)` — the complex finite
  product distributes over a factorwise product, the algebraic substrate for factoring the Hadamard
  product `∏(1 − s/ρ)` (item 5; e.g. splitting a factor across the product). Proved by induction on `N`
  over a new four-term product interchange `(a·b)·(c·d) ≈ (a·c)·(b·d)` (`Cmul_mul_mul_comm`, from
  `Cmul_assoc`/`Cmul_comm`) — the multiplicative mirror of `CsumN_add`'s `Cadd_add_add_comm`. Completes
  the multiplicative half of the `CprodN` API alongside `CprodN_congr`/`CprodN_succ_one`. Grep-verified
  novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 (item 0 — limit/series substrate) — negation closure `Clim_neg` / `CsumN_neg`**
  (`Analysis/ComplexLimit.lean`, `Analysis/ComplexSeries.lean`): `lim (−X) ≈ −lim X` and
  `Σ_{n<N} (−Fₙ) ≈ −(Σ_{n<N} Fₙ)` — the negation half of the complex limit/finite-sum linearity (with
  `Clim_add`/`CsumN_add`, the full additive-group structure; subtraction pervades the log-derivative
  `1 − Re(·)` / `−ζ′/ζ`). Both modulus-SAFE — negation does not inflate the sequence index, so `RReg` is
  preserved exactly (no rate doubling, unlike `Clim_add`). `Clim_neg` lifts the real `Rlim_neg`
  componentwise (still threading the transformed regularity as a hypothesis, the codebase idiom);
  `CsumN_neg` is an induction over the new `Cneg_Cadd` (`−(a+b) ≈ (−a)+(−b)`, from `Rneg_Radd`).
  Grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 (item 0 — limit substrate) — Bishop-limit additivity `Rlim_add` / `Clim_add`**
  (`Analysis/RlimProps.lean`, `Analysis/ComplexLimit.lean`): `lim (X + Y) ≈ lim X + lim Y` over ℝ and ℂ —
  the forced gateway to complex series linearity (`Cseries_add`) for splitting a witness / log-derivative
  series into its two component series (Hadamard `bl`, item 6). The real `Rlim_add` is the substantive
  piece: the `RTendsTo` rate would *double* under `Radd` (the known "modulus not closed under `Radd`"
  obstruction), so the canonical `RTendsTo_add` is false; instead the proof goes through
  `Req_of_lin_bound` (which absorbs the constant) and the key alignment that **both** diagonals land at the
  same sequence position `8n+7` — `lim(X+Y)` at `(X (4n+3))_{8n+7}` (the `Radd` index inflation
  `2·(4n+3)+1`), `(lim X)_{2n+1}` at `(X (8n+7))_{8n+7}` — so the gap is pure meta-regularity `RReg`,
  giving `5/(8(n+1)) ≤ 2/(n+1)` per component. `Clim_add` is then the clean componentwise lift. Both
  grep-verified novel, axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 (item 0 — complex-limit substrate) — zero limit `Clim_zero`**
  (`Analysis/ComplexLimit.lean`): a regular complex sequence pointwise `≈ 0` has limit `≈ 0` — the
  complex lift of the real `Rlim_zero` (`RlimProps.lean`, used real-side in the dyadic telescoping
  convergence proofs), the convergence side of a telescoped complex series of differences vanishing.
  Componentwise (both `Rlim_zero` halves), the companion of the existing `Clim_congr`. Grep-verified
  novel. Axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 (item 0/6 — complex-series substrate) — finite-sum linearity `CsumN_add`**
  (`Analysis/ComplexSeries.lean`): `Σ_{n<N} (Fₙ + Gₙ) ≈ (Σ_{n<N} Fₙ) + (Σ_{n<N} Gₙ)` — additivity of the
  complex partial sum, the forced algebraic substrate for splitting a witness / log-derivative series
  into its two component series (toward the Hadamard `bl` expansion, item 6). Proved by induction on `N`
  over a new four-term addition interchange `(a+b)+(c+d) ≈ (a+c)+(b+d)` (`Cadd_add_add_comm`, from
  `Cadd_assoc`/`Cadd_comm`); no real `RsumN_add` is needed — the swap is done directly over `Cadd`.
  Completes the additive half of the `CsumN` API alongside the existing `CsumN_congr`. Axiom-clean.
- **Crux frontier (`n = 3`) — tighter γ₁ upper `≤ −0.055`** (`Analysis/GammaOne.lean`, `Rgamma1_le_neg055`):
  the dominant `−6γ₁` contribution to the `Pos Rlambda3` (`λ₃`) certificate, tightened from `−0.0445`
  (`Rgamma1_le_neg445`, artanh depth `T = 2`) to `−0.055` at depth `T = 4` (`gBound200_T4_le_neg055`,
  a kernel `decide`). Diagnosis recorded: the residual gap to the true `γ₁ ≈ −0.0728` is the `gSeq`
  Euler–Maclaurin overshoot `+(ln N)/(2N)` (a *convergence* limit, not bound depth — raising `T`
  further plateaus), whose removal is the remaining `GammaTwoBracket`-scale acceleration (the single
  hardest `λ₃` brick).
- **Crux frontier (`n = 3`) — ζ(2)/ζ(3) brackets toward `Pos Rlambda3`** (`Analysis/ZetaTwo.lean`):
  the named-missing `ζ(2)` upper bound and two-sided `ζ(3)` for the `λ₃` positivity certificate. The
  reusable `zeta_le_partial` (`ζ(s) ≤ S(N) + 1/(N+1)`, the mirror of `zeta_ge_partial`, via the
  decreasing upper sequence `zetaU` and the rigorous tail-overestimate `Σ_{k>N+1} 1/kˢ ≤ 1/(N+1)`)
  gives `ζ(2) ≤ 1.646` (`zeta2_upper`; with `zeta2_lower ≥ 1.63` brackets the Basel constant) and
  `ζ(3) ∈ [1.201, 1.217]` (`zeta3_lower`/`zeta3_upper`, two-sided Apéry). These discharge two of the
  constant-precision inputs the `n = 3` coupling coefficient `Pos Rlambda3` needs (the dominant
  remaining gap is the tight two-sided `γ₁`). Axiom-clean.

- **Track 1 (item 1 — the Γ place on the strip) — the complex digamma term**
  (`Analysis/ComplexDigamma.lean`, increment 1): the archimedean `Γ′/Γ` series
  `ψ(s) = −γ + Σ_{n≥0} [1/(n+1) − 1/(s+n)]` lifted to complex `s` with `Re s ≥ c > 0` (the strip) —
  the piece of item 1 the real-line `Gamma.lean` does not provide. Built from the complex reciprocal
  `Cinv` ALONE (no `Cpow`/`Clog`), so it is entirely free of the `1/16` value-identity barrier. The
  term layer: the shifted argument `s+n` (`CdigammaArg`), its modulus-squared floor `|s+n|² ≥ c²`
  (`ofQ_le_CnormSq_CdigammaArg`, from `(Re s+n)² ≥ c²` and `(Im s)² ≥ 0`) and the resulting positivity
  witness `CdigammaArg_witness` (squared-floor analogue of the real `digammaArg_witness`), and the
  complex term `CdigammaTerm = 1/(n+1) − 1/(s+n)`. Per-term bounds, regular partial sums, and the
  limit object `CDigamma` follow in later increments via the generic `RReg_of_real_bound` engine.
  Axiom-clean.
  - **Increment 2a — the factored telescoping identity** `Cterm_n = (s−1)·P_n` with
    `P_n = 1/(n+1)·1/(s+n)` (`CdigammaTerm_factored`, complex analogue of the real
    `digammaTerm_eq_factored`). The engine is the abstract reciprocal-difference identity
    `Cadd_neg_eq_mul_of_inv` (`P − I ≈ (a−Q)·(P·I)` whenever `a·I ≈ 1`, `Q·P ≈ 1`, the ℂ analogue of
    `Rsub_eq_mul_of_inv`), instantiated with `a = s+n` (`Cmul_Cinv`) and `Q = n+1`
    (`Cmul_natSucc_inv`), then `(s+n)−(n+1) ≈ s−1` (`CdigammaArg_sub_succ_eq`). This factorization
    exposes the `O(1/n²)` decay (the `1/(n+1)` and `1/(s+n)` summands each only `O(1/n)`), the
    prerequisite for the per-term bounds.
  - **Increment 2b/2c — the per-term component bounds** `|Re P_n| ≤ 1/((n+1)n)` and
    `|Im P_n| ≤ B/((n+1)n)` (`|Im s| ≤ B`), via the inverse-comparison helper `x·(1/N) ≤ 1/x` when
    `x² ≤ N` (no cancellation), the modulus-squared floors `|s+n|² ≥ σ_n²` and `|s+n|² ≥ n`
    (`CnormSq_CdigammaArg_ge`), and the real-line `digamma_Rinv_le`. `Re P_n = F·(σ_n/N) ≤ F·(1/n)`
    and `Im P_n = F·((−Im s)/N)` bounded two-sidedly via an abstract product lemma. This is the
    `O(1/n²)` decay made rational — the input the generic `RReg_of_real_bound` engine needs.
  - **Increment 2d — the full term-component bounds** `|Re Cterm_n| ≤ (B1+B2²)/((n+1)n)` and
    `|Im Cterm_n| ≤ (B1·B2+B2)/((n+1)n)` (`|Re s−1| ≤ B1`, `|Im s| ≤ B2`), via
    `CdigammaTerm_re_bound`/`_im_bound`. From `Cterm = (s−1)·P`, each component is a sum/difference of
    two `±`-bounded products (combined by abstract `cdig_Rsub_prod_bound`/`cdig_Radd_prod_bound` over
    `Rmul_le_mul_of_abs`/`Rneg_mul_le_of_abs`), then collapsed to a single `K/((n+1)n)`. Both
    components are now summable `O(1/n²)` — the regular-partial-sums and `CDigamma` limit follow.
  - **Increment 3 — the limit object `CDigamma`** (the complex digamma on the strip). A generic
    convergence layer (`genSum`/`genTail_two_sided`/`genSum_RReg`) — any real term sequence with
    `|T n| ≤ K/((n+1)n)` has regular `K`-reindexed partial sums — reusing the real-line telescoping
    infrastructure (`digammaRsum`/`digammaMidx`/`digammaTailQ_Midx_le`) and the generic
    `RReg_of_real_bound` engine. Instantiated for both `Re Cterm` and `Im Cterm`
    (`CdigammaReSum_RReg`/`CdigammaImSum_RReg`), giving the **constructive complex
    `ψ(s) = −γ + Σ_{n≥0}[1/(n+1) − 1/(s+n)]`** as `⟨Rlim Re-sums, Rlim Im-sums⟩` (the `Ceta`/`Czeta`
    componentwise-limit pattern), with `−γ` on the real part. This is **item 1's barrier-free
    archimedean piece complete**: the real-line `Digamma` lifted to complex `s` on the strip, built
    from `Cinv` alone.
  - **Increment 4 — the complex Spouge bracket** `c₀ + Σ_{k=1}^N cₖ/(s+k)` (`CspougeBracket`), the
    `Cinv`-sum core of the complex Spouge `Γ` on the strip. Mirrors the real `spougeBracketAux` with
    `Rinv → Cinv` and the real coefficients scaled in via `ofReal`, reusing the `CdigammaArg`
    reciprocal-witness machinery — barrier-free (no `Cpow`/`Clog`). Non-vacuity `cspougeBracketWitness`
    at `s=1, a=4, N=2`. Note: the complex `Cpow`/`Clog` *definition* needs only the argument ratio
    `< 1` (not the `1/16` value identity, which is only for additivity *properties*), so the base power
    `(s+a)^{s+½}` and the full `Γ` assembly are buildable barrier-free by choosing the Spouge shift `a`
    large enough to keep the base's argument small — the remaining item-1 pieces.
  - **Increment 5 — the complex Spouge `Γ` approximant `CSpougeGamma`** (item 1's `Γ(s/2)`-on-the-strip
    object). The faithful complex lift of the real `SpougeGamma`: `Γ(s+1) ≈ (s+a)^{s+½}·e^{−(s+a)}·[c₀ +
    Σ_{k=1}^N cₖ/(s+k)]` for complex `s` (`Re s ≥ c > 0`), assembled from `Cpow` (base power), `Cexp`,
    and the `CspougeBracket`. The base power's `Clog`/`Carg` need only the argument-ratio bound `< 1`
    (a caller hypothesis, satisfied by taking the shift `a` large relative to `|Im s|`) — not the
    `1/16` value identity — so the construction is barrier-free; positivity witnesses
    (`CspougeBase_cnormSq_witness`/`_re_witness`, floor `|s+a|² ≥ c²`) come from the floor `c`. As for
    the real `SpougeGamma`, this is the constructive approximant object (no `Ceq` to the true `Γ`
    asserted). **Item 1's complex `Γ` on the strip is now built** (object-level), alongside the
    barrier-free complex digamma `CDigamma`.
  - **Increment 6 — the direct `Γ(w)` Spouge variant `CSpougeGammaW`** (`Re w > 0`), the
    strip-applicable form for `Γ(s/2)` (`Re(s/2) ∈ (0,½)`). `Γ(w) ≈ (w+b)^{w−½}·e^{−(w+b)}·[c₀ +
    Σ_{k=1}^N cₖ/(w+(k−1))]` (Spouge with `z = w−1`, base shift `b = a−1`, terms `1/(w+(k−1))`). Unlike
    `CSpougeGamma(w−1)`, every node (`w+b`, `w+(k−1)` for `k ≥ 1`) keeps `Re > 0` for `Re w > 0`,
    `b ≥ 0`, so it is valid throughout the strip — the prerequisite for assembling
    `ξ(s) = ½ s(s−1) π^{−s/2} Γ(s/2) ζ(s)` (item 2; the other factors `π^{−s/2}` via `Cpow` over the
    real `Rpi` base, and `ζ` via `CzetaStrip`, are in hand).
- **Track 1 (item 2 — the completed ξ, assembled)** (`Analysis/ComplexXi.lean`). The conductor factor
  `π^{−s/2} = exp((−s/2)·log π)` (`CpiPow`) built from the *real* `log π = Rlog_pi` (`Pi.lean`) embedded
  as `⟨log π, 0⟩` — sidestepping the complex `Clog`/`Carg`/`cnormSq` of `π` entirely (no `1/16` barrier,
  and no infeasible `Rpi²` `whnf`; `Rlog_pi` stays an opaque atom). The polynomial prefactor `½·s·(s−1)`
  (`CxiPoly`, entire, taming `ζ`'s pole at `s=1`), and the **product assembly**
  `Cxi s gammaHalf zeta = ½s(s−1)·π^{−s/2}·Γ(s/2)·ζ(s)` (`Cxi`), with the heavy-data factors `Γ(s/2)`
  (via `CSpougeGammaW` at `s/2`) and `ζ(s)` (via `CzetaStrip`) passed as already-built values to keep
  the interface clean. This is the constructive **assembly** of ξ from the item-1 / Track-1 pieces; the
  analytic *properties* (functional equation, order-1 bound, Hadamard) of items 3–5 are separate and
  not asserted. Axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 — `Rlim` congruence infrastructure** (`Analysis/RlimProps.lean`): `Rlim_congr` (pointwise
  `≈` regular sequences have `≈` diagonal limits — from `Req` at index `4n+3`, since `2/(4n+4) ≤
  2/(n+1)`) and `Rlim_neg` (`lim(−X) ≈ −lim X`, seq-equal hence definitional). The limit-level
  congruences any property/convergence argument over `Rlim`-built objects needs — e.g. the complex
  digamma's symmetries and the eventual `CSpougeGamma → Γ` convergence. Axiom-clean. Also
  `Rinv_congr` (`1/x ≈ 1/y` from `x ≈ y`, across different positivity witnesses — via the cancellation
  `1/x ≈ (1/x)(y/y) ≈ (1/x)(x/y) ≈ 1/y`, no witness-dependent reindexing), filling a previously-missing
  reciprocal congruence.
- **Track 1 — real-part conjugation invariance of the complex digamma** `Re ψ(s̄) = Re ψ(s)`
  (`CDigamma_re_conj`, `Analysis/ComplexDigammaConj.lean`), a genuine *property* of the constructed
  `CDigamma`. Since `Re(1/(s+n)) = (Re s+n)/|s+n|²` and `|s+n|²` is conjugation-invariant (`Im` enters
  only squared, `CnormSq_CdigammaArg_conj`), every term's real part agrees (`CdigammaTerm_re_conj`, via
  `Rinv_congr`), so the two real-part partial-sum sequences are pointwise `≈` (`genSum_congr`) and their
  diagonal limits agree (`Rlim_congr`). This is the archimedean face of ξ's conjugate-pair zero
  symmetry; the line `Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2)` of Track 2 is its instance. The first verified analytic
  property atop the item-1 objects (advancing beyond the approximant constructions). Axiom-clean.
  Now extended to the **full conjugation symmetry** `ψ(s̄) = conj ψ(s)` (`CDigamma_conj`, a `Ceq`):
  the imaginary part flips, `Im ψ(s̄) = −Im ψ(s)` (`CDigamma_im_conj`), since `Im(1/(s+n)) = −Im s/|s+n|²`
  negates under `s ↦ s̄` while `|s+n|²` stays fixed — proved via the new generic `genSum_neg`
  (`Σ(−T) = −ΣT`) and `RReg_neg` (regularity preserved under negation), then `Rlim_neg`. This is the
  archimedean place's reflection symmetry (ξ's conjugate-pair zero structure), and it exercises the
  full `Rlim_congr`/`Rlim_neg`/`Rinv_congr` toolkit.
- **Track 1 — conjugation symmetry of the completed ξ, reduced to the Γ/ζ factor symmetries**
  (`Analysis/ComplexXiConj.lean`): `ξ(s̄) = conj ξ(s)` (`Cxi_conj`) — the structural symmetry behind
  ξ's conjugate-pair zeros. Two factors are conjugation-symmetric outright: the conductor `π^{−s/2}`
  (`CpiPow_conj`, via the reusable `Cexp_conj`, no `Clog`/modulus baggage) and the polynomial
  `½s(s−1)` (`CxiPoly_conj`, pure ℂ-ring algebra). The `Γ(s/2)` and `ζ(s)` factors enter `Cxi` as
  supplied values, so their conjugation is taken as explicit hypotheses and `Cxi_conj` distributes
  `Cconj` through the product — isolating the genuine remaining content (the Γ conjugation, a large
  `Clog`/`Cpow` chain; the ζ conjugation) as named audit-visible hypotheses, the program's standard
  relocation. Axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 — the complex digamma value anchor** `ψ(1) = −γ` (`CDigamma_one`,
  `Analysis/ComplexDigammaValue.lean`): the convention witness that the constructed `CDigamma` is
  genuinely `Γ′/Γ` (complex lift of the real `Digamma_one_eq_neg_gamma`). At `s = 1` the factored term
  `Cterm_n = (s−1)·P_n` vanishes (`CdigammaTerm_one_eq_zero`, since `s−1 = 0` via `Cadd_neg` and
  `0·P = 0`), so both real and imaginary partial sums are pointwise `≈ 0` and their limits vanish
  (`CDigammaCore_one_eq_zero`, via `genSum_congr` to the all-zero sequence + the reusable `Rlim_zero`),
  giving `ψ(1) = −γ + 0 = −γ`. Also adds the reusable `Rlim_zero` (pointwise-`0` regular sequence ⟹
  limit `0`) and `genSum_const_zero`. Axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 — left-sector argument additivity** `CargLeft(zw) = CargLeft z + Carg w`
  (`Analysis/ComplexArgLeftAdd.lean`): left-half-plane `z` (`Re z < 0`) times principal `w`, the
  product again left. Reflects the principal `Carg_add` through the `+π` shift via `−(zw) = (−z)·w`
  (`Cneg_Cmul_left`): both `−z` and `w` are right half-plane, so `arg(−(zw)) = arg(−z) + arg w` and
  the `+π` regroups to `(arg(−z) + π) + arg w = CargLeft z + Carg w`. With this, the cross-sector
  additivity `arg(zw) = arg z + arg w` is now proved in all four sectors (principal, upper, lower,
  left) — argument additivity over the whole punctured plane. Axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 — the left-half-plane argument (full-plane atan2)** `CargLeft` (`Analysis/ComplexArgLeft.lean`)
  with the `π` values (`Analysis/TanPiQuarter.lean`): `cos π = −1`, `sin π = 0` (`Rcos_pi`/`Rsin_pi`,
  double-angle on `π/2 = Rpi_half`), the π-shift formulas `sin(x+π) = −sin x`, `cos(x+π) = −cos x`
  (`Rsin_add_pi`/`Rcos_add_pi`), and `CargLeft z = arg(−z) + π` for `Re z < 0` with genuine tangent
  `tan(CargLeft z) = Im z/Re z` (`CargLeft_tan`, value identity on `−z` + π-shift, `tan(A+π) = tan A`).
  With the principal `Carg`, `CargUpper`, and `CargLower`, the argument is now defined over the whole
  punctured plane near the four axes — the `Re z < 0` quadrants of `atan2`. Axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 — the general complex power** `z^w = exp(w·log z)` (`Analysis/ComplexPowGen.lean`,
  `Cpow`), the bridge from item 0's complex logarithm to item 1's complex Γ. Where `ncpow` gives only
  `n^s` for a *natural* base `n ≥ 2` (the ζ Dirichlet terms), `Cpow` raises a *complex* base on the
  principal sector — needed for Spouge's `(z+a)^{z+1/2}` in `Γ(s/2)` and `π^{−s/2}` in `ξ`. Defined as
  `Cexp(w·Clog z)`; the exponent law `z^{w₁+w₂} = z^{w₁}·z^{w₂}` (`Cpow_add_exp`) is immediate from
  `Cexp_add` + distributivity, and the **base law `(zw)^v = z^v·w^v`** (`Cpow_mul_base`) follows from
  the `Clog` additivity of item 0 (`Clog_add`) + distributivity + `Cexp_add` — concretely bridging
  item 0 to item 1. Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`).
- **Track 1 — the lower-sector argument + its additivity** `CargLower` (`Analysis/ComplexArgLower.lean`):
  for `Im z < 0`, `arg(z) = −arg(z̄)` (`CargLower z = −CargUpper(Cconj z)`, `z̄` upper). Genuine
  tangent `tan(CargLower z) = Im z/Re z` (`CargLower_tan`, from `CargUpper_tan` of `z̄` + sin-oddness /
  cos-evenness), and additivity `CargLower(zw) = Carg z + CargLower w` (`CargLower_add`) — the
  conjugate reflection of `CargUpper_add` through `Cconj_Cmul` (`z̄w̄ = (zw)‾`) and `CargUpper_congr`.
  Completes the argument across all four wedges near the axes (ξ's zeros are conjugate pairs).
  Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`).
- **Track 1 — ★★ cross-sector complex-logarithm additivity** `Clog(zw) = Clog z + Clog w` past
  `|arg| < π/4` (`Analysis/ComplexLogUpperAdd.lean`, `ClogUpper_add`): `ClogUpper(zw) = Clog z +
  ClogUpper w` for principal `z` × upper `w` (product upper). Real half from the modulus hypothesis
  `hmod` + `Rmul_distrib` (as in `Clog_add`); imaginary half the *fully discharged* cross-sector
  argument additivity `CargUpper_add`. The complex logarithm is now additive across the
  principal/upper boundary — the second-sector capstone of substrate item 0. Axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 — ★★ cross-sector argument additivity** `arg(zw) = arg z + arg w` across the
  principal/upper boundary (`Analysis/ComplexArgUpperAdd.lean`, `CargUpper_add`):
  `CargUpper(zw) = Carg z + CargUpper w` for principal `z` (`Re z > 0`) × upper `w` (`Im w > 0`),
  product upper, all ratios `< 1/16`. The clean reduction via the coordinate swap `swapC z =
  ⟨Im z, Re z⟩`: `CargUpper z = π/2 − Carg(swapC z)` and the exact identity `swapC(zw) = swapC w · z̄`
  (`swapC_Cmul_Cconj`, componentwise), so `CargUpper(zw) = π/2 − Carg(swapC w · z̄) =
  π/2 − Carg(swapC w) − Carg(z̄) = CargUpper w + Carg z` — reusing the principal `Carg_add` and the
  conjugate symmetry `Carg_conj`. Reusable congruence gaps filled: `Rdiv_congr` (division respects
  `≈`, via denominator cancellation `Rdiv_mul_cancel`/`Rmul_right_cancel` — no `Rinv`-congruence
  needed) and `Carg_congr` (the argument respects `≈`). Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`). The
  argument is now additive across `|arg| < π/4`, not only within it.
- **Track 1 — ★ argument conjugate symmetry** `arg(z̄) = −arg z` (`Analysis/ComplexArgUpper.lean`,
  `Carg_conj`): `Carg(Cconj z) = −Carg z`. Since `Cconj z = ⟨Re z, −Im z⟩` has ratio `−(Im z/Re z)` and
  `arctan` is odd (`RarctanR_neg`, via `RarctanR_congr` on the ratio `Rmul_neg_left`). A building block
  of cross-sector additivity (it turns a subtracted angle into a conjugate factor). Axiom-clean.
- **Track 1 — `arctan` is odd** `arctan(−t) = −arctan t` (`Analysis/RArctanValue.lean`,
  `RarctanR_neg`, with rational `arctanTerm_neg`/`arctanSum_neg`) — the conjugate symmetry of the
  argument (`arg(z̄) = −arg z`), since `arctan` sums only odd powers. From the artanh-term oddness
  `artTerm_neg` (`(−1)ⁿ` factor preserved). A foundational reusable property toward the cross-sector
  argument additivity. Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`).
- **Track 1 — the complex logarithm past `|arg| < π/4`** (`Analysis/ComplexLogUpper.lean`,
  `ClogUpper`): `ClogUpper z = ½·log|z|² + i·(π/2 − arctan(Re/Im))` on the upper sector (`Im z > 0`,
  `|Re/Im| ≤ ρ < 1`, i.e. `|arg| ∈ (π/4, π/2]`) — the extension of the principal `Clog` past its
  `|arg| < π/4` domain. Real part = the same genuine modulus log `½·log|z|²`; imaginary part = the
  genuine second-sector argument `CargUpper` (`CargUpper_tan`). Anchored by `Im (ClogUpper i) = π/2`
  (`ClogUpper_I_im`, i.e. `log i = i·π/2`). Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`). (Cross-sector
  additivity — the full-plane atan2 — is the following brick.)
- **Track 1 — ★ the upper-half argument is genuine** `tan(CargUpper z) = Im z/Re z`
  (`Analysis/ComplexArgUpper.lean`, `CargUpper_tan`): `sin(CargUpper z) = (Im/Re)·cos(CargUpper z)`
  for `Im z > 0`, `Re z` apart from `0`, `|Re/Im| ≤ ρ < 1/16` (the steep wedge off the imaginary
  axis). Confirms the second-sector argument `CargUpper z = π/2 − arctan(Re/Im)` is the genuine
  argument (not just a definition): the reciprocal reduction gives `tan(π/2 − arctan(Re/Im)) =
  1/(Re/Im) = Im/Re`. Built from the real-argument value identity `RarctanR_value_eq`
  (`tan(arctan(Re/Im)) = Re/Im`), the real complementary tangent `Rsin_cos_pi_half_sub_tan_real`, and
  the reciprocal `(Im/Re)·(Re/Im) = 1` (`Rmul_Rinv_self`). The second-sector analogue of the
  principal-sector `tan(Carg z) = Im/Re`. Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`).
- **Track 1 — ★★ the real-argument value identity** `sin(arctan t) = t·cos(arctan t)` for a REAL
  argument `t` (`Analysis/RArctanValue.lean`, `RarctanR_value_eq`) — the keystone lifting the
  rational `Rsin_arctan_value_eq` (fixed `t₀`, the heart of `tan(arctan t₀)=t₀`) to a real ratio, as
  `Carg z = arctan(Im z/Re z)` and its reciprocal extension require. The lift is NOT naive
  approximation (which blows up the Lipschitz constant via the approximants' denominators): it clones
  the nested-diagonal bridge directly for `RarctanR t`, sampling the argument at one deep index
  `q = t.seq(Rartanh_R ρ D)` per diagonal step, where the `t₀`-parametric composition lemmas
  (`cos_nested_general`/`sin_nested_general`, `|t₀| ≤ ρ`) apply — so all bounds stay `ρ.den`-based.
  `Rcos_RarctanR_nested` / `Rsin_RarctanR_nested` are the cos/sin real-argument nested bounds (the
  `Rmul` reconciliation is `X`-regularity, argument-agnostic). The capstone triangle:
  `sin(arctan t).seq n →[Rsin nested] peval(sin∘arctan) q (2D+1) →[degree shift, exact]
  q·peval(cos∘arctan) q (2D) →[Rcos nested] q·(Rcos(arctan t)).seq R →[reg] t·cos`, the new leg over
  the rational case being the factor reconciliation `q ↦ t` (sin-shift factor `q` vs `Rmul` factor
  `t`), discharged by `t`-regularity and the `|Rcos| ≤ expM_U 1 2` bound (`altSum_abs_le_U`). The
  sqrt-free real-argument `tan∘arctan = id` — the substrate of the reciprocal `Carg`/`Clog` lift.
  Axiom-clean (`{propext, Quot.sound}`).
- **Track 1 — ★ the reciprocal/complementary tangent** `tan(π/2 − A) = 1/tan A`
  (`Analysis/TanPiQuarter.lean`, `Rsin_cos_pi_half_sub_tan` + `TanReal.compl`) — the value-level
  engine of the reciprocal reduction `arctan t = π/2 − arctan(1/t)`, which is how the argument axis
  reaches `|arg| ≥ π/4`. From the complementary formulas `sin(π/2 − x) = cos x`, `cos(π/2 − x) = sin x`
  (`Rsin_pi_half_sub` / `Rcos_pi_half_sub`, themselves from `Rsin_sub` / the new `Rcos_sub` and the
  `π/2` values) and `sin A = s·cos A`: if `A` has tangent `s` and `t·s = 1`, then `π/2 − A` has
  tangent `t` (`t·cos(π/2−A) = t·sin A = t·s·cos A = cos A = sin(π/2−A)`). `TanReal.compl` packages
  this as a bundle operation, so a small-argument leaf (`|s| < 1/16`) yields a LARGE-tangent angle
  that still composes with `.add`/`.step` — tangents beyond the value-identity radius are now
  constructible (`tan_pi_half_sub_arctan_eighteen`: `tan(π/2 − arctan(1/18)) = 18`). Axiom-clean
  (`{propext, Quot.sound}`). (The full-plane `Carg` atan2 with quadrant `±π` shifts is the next brick.)
- **Track 1 — ★ `tan(π/4) = 1` and the `π/2` values `cos(π/2) = 0`, `sin(π/2) = 1`**
  (`Analysis/TanPiQuarter.lean`, `sin_eq_cos_pi4` / `Rcos_pi_half` / `Rsin_pi_half`) — the anchors of
  the **full-range complex argument** (`Carg`/`Clog` past the principal sector `|arg| < π/4`, via the
  reciprocal reduction `arctan t = π/2 − arctan(1/t)`). The obstacle this clears: the value identity
  `sin(arctan t) = t·cos(arctan t)` (`Rsin_arctan_value_eq`) holds only for `|t| < 1/16` (the
  nested-composition radius forced by `DN_arctan_decay`), but Machin's
  `π = 16·arctan(1/5) − 4·arctan(1/239)` uses `1/5 > 1/16`. The fix is **Gauss's Machin-like formula**
  `π/4 = 12·arctan(1/18) + 8·arctan(1/57) − 5·arctan(1/239)`, all three arguments `< 1/16` (common
  radius `ρ = 1/18`): the value identity applies to each leaf, and the 25-leaf chain is built through
  `Rsin_cos_add_tan` (which needs only `1 − ab > 0`, never that the *output* tangent is small), so the
  running tangent climbs to exactly `1` while every step's `|running·leaf| ≤ 0.039`. A `TanReal` bundle
  (`angle`, rational `tan`, `sin = tan·cos`) with `.add`/`.retag`/`.step` carries the chain (each
  step's tangent relabelled to a `Qeq`-equal literal to keep the positivity `decide`s shallow); the
  exact rational tangent of the combination is `vval`-checked to be `1`, giving `sin(π/4) = cos(π/4)`.
  Double-angle on `π/2 = 2·(π/4)` (`Rcos_add_of_tan`, `Rsin_add_of_tan`) then yields
  `cos(π/2) = 1 − 1·1 = 0` and, via Pythagoras, `sin(π/2) = 2·cos²(π/4) = 1`. Axiom-clean
  (`{propext, Quot.sound}`). (Consistency `Rpi = 4·Spi4.angle` with the Machin `Rpi` of `Pi.lean`, and
  the reciprocal arctan reduction + lift to `Carg`/`Clog`, are the following bricks.)
- **Track 1 — ★ the arctan addition law** `arctan a + arctan b = arctan((a+b)/(1−ab))`
  (`Analysis/ArctanTan.lean`, `Rarctan_add` / `Rarctan_add_of_small`): the imaginary half of `Clog`
  additivity, built on the value-level `tan` substrate below. The chain: the abstract
  tangent-addition capstone `Req_add_of_tan_values` (the arctan analog of `Req_add_of_exp_values` —
  `A+B=C` from the tangent *values* via `Rsin_cos_add_tan` + tangent-injectivity `Rtan_inj`); the
  `RsinAux` apartness `Pos_RsinAux_of_small` (`sin w/w ≥ 1/2` for `|w| ≤ 1`, since the degree-2 head
  `1−w²/6+w⁴/120 ≥ 5/6` by `altSum_sin_two_ge` and the tail is `≤ 2/6` by `altSum_trunc_bound`); and
  the angle-difference magnitude bound `Rarctan_diff_seq_le` (each angle `≤ 2ρ` via `Rarctan_seq_abs_le`
  + `geoSum_le_two`, so the `Radd`/`Rsub`-reindexed difference is `≤ 6ρ ≤ 1` via `Qmul_two_le_third`
  from `16ρ < 1`). `Rarctan_add_of_small` then makes the apartness automatic — the law holds for any
  `|a|, |b|, |(a+b)/(1−ab)| ≤ ρ` with the shared `ρ < 1/16` thicket and `1 − ab > 0`. **Lifted to real
  arguments** (`RarctanR_add_real_via`): `arctan s + arctan t = arctan((s+t)/(1−st))` for reals `s, t`
  with `Y = RarctanR(vvalReal s t)` — the arctan analog of `Rartanh_add_real_via`, cleaner since the
  `vval` denominator is sign-robust (no `wvalR`-style split). Two legs through
  `W = arctanSum(vval(s_P,t_P),·)`: the argument-variation `arctanSum_vval_argdiff`
  (`≤ 12(|a−a'|+|b−b'|)`) and the combination `RarctanConst_add_vval_rho` (= `Rarctan_add_of_small`
  read at the diagonal index). **Packaged as complex argument additivity** `arg(zw) = arg z + arg w`
  (`Analysis/ComplexArgAdd.lean`, `Carg_add`): for `z, w` with `Re z, Re w, Re(zw)` apart from `0` and
  the three ratios `Im/Re ≤ ρ < 1/16`, `Carg(zw) = Carg z + Carg w`. The bridge is the complex-division
  **ratio identity** `Im(zw)/Re(zw) ≈ vvalReal(ratio z, ratio w)`, proved by cross-multiplication: the
  `vvalReal` defining relation `vvalReal_rel_via` (`V·(1−st) ≈ s+t`, the rational `vval_rel` lifted to
  the diagonal by regularity) feeds the real-algebra cross-identity `ratio_cross_via`
  (`vvalReal(r_z,r_w)·Re(zw) = Im(zw)`), which together with `Rdiv_mul_cancel` and `Rmul_right_cancel`
  gives the identity; then `RarctanR_congr` + `RarctanR_add_real_via` close it. **This completes the
  imaginary (harder) half of `Clog` additivity.**
- **Track 1 — ★ complex logarithm additivity** `Clog(zw) = Clog z + Clog w` (`ComplexArgAdd.lean`,
  `Clog_add`): the capstone of substrate item 0. `Clog z = ½·log|z|² + i·arg z`, so additivity splits
  into the modulus half (`RlogPos`-multiplicativity) and the imaginary half (`Carg_add`, fully
  discharged). `Clog(zw).re = ½·log|zw|² ≈ ½(log|z|²+log|w|²) = Clog z.re + Clog w.re` (`Rmul_distrib`),
  `Clog(zw).im = Carg(zw) = Carg z + Carg w` (`Carg_add`). The general positive-real
  log-multiplicativity `log|zw|² = log|z|²+log|w|²` (via `cnormSq_mul` + `Rlog_mul` + integer-part
  telescoping) is the one explicit audit-visible hypothesis, isolated exactly as the program isolates
  each heavy input — RH-*independent*, no smuggling. Crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1 — ★ the `Clog_add` modulus seam discharged for bounded moduli** (`Analysis/RlogMulPos.lean`,
  `Analysis/ClogAddBounded.lean`): the `hmod` hypothesis of `Clog_add` is now a **theorem**, not an
  assumption, in the small-radius regime (squared moduli `1 ≤ |z|², |w|² ≤ B`). The substrate stack:
  `reindex_Req` (a regular sequence reindexed past its tail presents the same real); `Rlog_congr`
  (`Rlog` is a congruence in its argument at small radius, `tmap_lip` lifted through `Rartanh_congr`);
  `RlogPos_unfold` (`RlogPos x k = Rlog (reindexed x) Mx` at the auto-derived radius, definitional);
  the **`RlogPos → Rlog` bridge** `RlogPos_eq_Rlog` (auto-radius log = presented-radius `Rlog x B`,
  routed through `Rartanh_radius_indep` `Mx→B` then `Rlog_congr` along `reindex_Req` — crucially only
  `B` need be small, not the loose auto-radius); `RlogPos_mul` (`log(xy) = log x + log y` for positive
  reals in `[1,B]`, bridging all three `RlogPos` calls into `Rlog_mul`); and `RlogPos_congr` (carrying
  `RlogPos` across `≈`). Assembled in `RlogPos_cnormSq_mul` — exactly the `hmod` proposition,
  `log|zw|² = log|z|²+log|w|²`, from elementary positivity/bound data via `cnormSq_mul`. The capstone
  `Clog_add_bounded` then states `Clog(zw) = Clog z + Clog w` with **no** `RlogPos`-multiplicativity
  hypothesis. Crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1 — ★★ symmetric-band `Clog` additivity (signed-τ)** (`Analysis/RlogMulSigned.lean`):
  `Clog_add_signed` extends the modulus-seam discharge from `[1,B]` to the **symmetric band**
  `[1/B, B]` — squared moduli on *either* side of 1 (the realistic Hadamard regime, where the
  `artanh` argument `tmap(x.seq)` turns negative). The signed substrate, built bottom-up via the
  **oddness route** that sidesteps re-deriving the `t≥0` corner bounds: `exp(2·artanh τ)=(1+τ)/(1−τ)`
  for `τ<0` follows from the nonneg case by `artanh(−σ)=−artanh σ` (`Rartanh_neg`) + exp-of-negation
  (`Rexp_TwoArtanh_of_neg`), unified sign-agnostically (`Rexp_TwoArtanh_signed_rho`). Then the signed
  addition law `TwoArtanh_add_wvalR_rho` (three signed exp-identities through `Req_add_of_exp_values_gen`
  + the signed multiplicativity `wvalR_hg`), its `×2`-strip `RartanhConst_add_wvalR_rho`, the signed
  real lift `Rartanh_add_real_via_signed` (the arg-variation/`wvalR` den-positivity legs were already
  sign-agnostic), the signed real log-multiplicativity `Rlog_mul_signed` (`tmap_abs_lt_one` two-sided
  + `wvalR_tmap_seq_bound_signed`), `RlogPos_mul_signed`, and the assembly
  `RlogPos_cnormSq_mul_signed`/`Clog_add_signed` (witness from a lower bound, `pos_witness_of_mulM_ge`,
  since the squared-modulus product may dip below 1). Crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1 — ★★★ general-modulus complex `Clog` additivity (`ρ<1` relaxation)** (`Analysis/RadiusGen.lean`):
  `Clog_add_gen` removes the small-radius cap entirely — `Clog(zw) = Clog z + Clog w` with the modulus
  seam `hmod` discharged for squared moduli in `[1/B, B]` at **any** `B ≥ 1`. The load-bearing
  finding: `ρ²≤1/2` was never needed for convergence, only for the clean constant `2`; the artanh
  reindex `(ρ.den²+4ρ.den)(n+1)` already absorbs the general even-sum bound `Σρ^{2k} ≤ 1/(1−ρ²) ~
  ρ.den/2`, with the **canonical `K = ρ.den`** valid for every `ρ<1`. The full `_gen` stack (~20
  lemmas): `geoEvenSum_le_gen` → `Rartanh_congr_gen`/`artSum_depth_recip_gen`/`Rartanh_radius_indep_gen`
  (continuity) → `Rlog_congr_gen`/`RlogPos_eq_Rlog_gen`/`RlogPos_congr_gen` (bridge) →
  `wval_halfbound_gen` (denominator factor `ρ.den` vs `2`)/`wval_lip1_gen`/`wval_lip2_gen`
  (Lipschitz constant `ρ.den²` vs `4`)/`wval_inner_pos_gen` → `artSum_wval_argdiff_gen`
  (constant `Kσ·ρ.den²`) → `Rartanh_add_real_via_gen` (the real artanh addition diagonal; combination
  leg already radius-agnostic) → `wvalReal_gen`/`tmul_wvalReal_via_gen` (reindex `2ρ.den²(n+1)`
  absorbing the larger constant) → `Rlog_mul_via_gen` → `Rlog_mul_gen` → `RlogPos_mul_gen` →
  `RlogPos_cnormSq_mul_gen` → `Clog_add_gen`. Substrate item 0's modulus seam is now closed at full
  generality. Crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1 — ★ value-level `sin(arctan t) = t·cos(arctan t)`** (`Analysis/ArctanODE.lean`,
  `Rsin_arctan_value_eq`): `Req (Rsin (Rarctan t₀)) (Rmul (ofQ t₀) (Rcos (Rarctan t₀)))` for
  `|t₀| ≤ ρ < 1/16`. This **completes the formal-PS → value (FTC) bridge** that lifts the formal
  identity `sin∘arctan = t·(cos∘arctan)` (`sin_arctan_eq`) to the constructive reals — the sole
  remaining gap for argument-additivity, and the `artanh`-free analog of the real `artanh` doubling.
  The full stack, built from scratch on the corner-decay machinery: the closed `C/(n+1)` decay rate
  `DN_arctan_decay` (the `(M+1)²` polynomial absorbs into the geometric base only at `ρ < 1/16`, via
  `sq_le_four_pow`), the reciprocal composition bounds `DN_{sin,cos}_recip`, the degree-shift identity
  `peval_sin_arctan_shift : peval(sin∘arctan,t,m+1) = t·peval(cos∘arctan,t,m)` (no division — `sin =
  t·cos` directly), the diagonal↔peval identifications (`Rcos_seq_eq_peval`, `RsinAux_seq_eq_peval`),
  the argument-Lipschitz bounds (`peval_cosCoeff_Lip`, `peval_{cos,sin}Coeff_arctan_argdiff_recip`,
  via `altSum_Lip_le` + `qsq_diff_le` with `LipS` bounded uniformly by `LipS_le_U`), the geometric
  arctan tail `geoSum_diff_recip`, and the nested-diagonal cores `cos_nested_general`/`sin_nested_general`
  with their real wrappers `Rcos_arctan_nested`/`Rsin_arctan_nested` — the latter handling the **`Rmul`
  reconciliation** (`Rsin = Rmul X (RsinAux X)` evaluates `X` at the outer reindex but `RsinAux`
  internally at a deeper one; the gap `|X.seq R − X.seq D|·|RsinAux|` is killed by `X`'s regularity).
  The final `Req_of_lin_bound` is a 3-term triangle through `peval(sin∘arctan)` and the shift.
  RH-*independent* analytic infrastructure; crux fields stay `none`.

- **The RH witness** (`F1Square/Analysis/RHWitness.lean`) — the constructive witness of RH's forward
  direction (`RH ⟹ λₙ ≥ 0`), exhibited as an object. On the critical line a zero's Cayley factor
  `w = 1−1/ρ` has unit modulus; unit modulus survives every power via the Atlas composition norm
  (`cnormSq_npow` over `cnormSq_mul`, the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci / Hurwitz two-square identity), so
  `|wⁿ|² = 1`, hence `Re(wⁿ) ≤ 1` with NO `sqrt` (`Rle_of_Rmul_self_le`). Each Li term `1 − Re(wⁿ)` is
  thus manifestly `≥ 0` (`witnessTerm_nonneg`), and the finite witness sum `Σ (1 − Re(wⁿ))` is `≥ 0`
  for every `n` (`witnessSum_nonneg`, `rh_witness`). Strengthened from unit modulus to the **closed
  half-plane** `|w|² ≤ 1` (`Re ρ ≥ ½`, `cnormSq_Cnpow_le_one` via `Rnpow_le_Rnpow`); `rh_witness_onLine`
  is the boundary (on-line) face. The hypothesis IS RH (`onLine_is_unit_modulus`) and is never
  discharged — producing the witness unconditionally is RH itself.
- **The functional-equation reflection + conjugation symmetry** (`F1Square/Analysis/Reflection.lean`)
  — the completed-ζ 4-fold zero symmetry `{ρ, ρ̄, 1−ρ, 1−ρ̄}` realized on the Li growth ratio as exact
  `Real` algebra. Reflection `ρ↦1−ρ`: `cnormSq(1−ρ) = csubOneNormSq ρ`, `csubOneNormSq(1−ρ) = cnormSq ρ`
  (via `Rneg_sq`/`Rneg_Rsub`), so the mirror Cayley ratios are reciprocal (`r(ρ)·r(1−ρ) = 1`), and
  `mirror_both_in_disk_iff`: a zero and its mirror are both in the closed Cayley disk iff `|ρ−1|² = |ρ|²`
  (unit modulus, on the line). Conjugation `ρ↦ρ̄` (`Cconj`) preserves both moduli, hence disk-membership
  (`inClosedDisk_Cconj`); `symmetry_orbit_in_disk_iff` shows the whole orbit lies in the disk iff on the
  line — the structural reason RH's "all zeros in the disk" equals "all zeros on the line". Does not
  prove the zeros are there (RH, untouched).
- **The Voros off-line branch, constructively** (`Reflection.lean`, `Analysis/OffLineGrowth.lean`) —
  `offLine_left_not_inClosedDisk`: a zero left of the line leaves the closed Cayley disk
  (`liRatio_left_of_line` ⟹ `|w|² > 1`), the geometric seed of the off-line branch, *proven*.
  `offLine_term_grows`: its witness term's squared modulus then strictly grows (`|wⁿ⁺¹|²−|wⁿ|² > 0`);
  `witnessTerm_tempered`: on the closed disk the term is bounded in `[0,2]`; `voros_term_dichotomy`
  packages the tempered-vs-exponential alternative at the term level. The step from exponential growth
  to a negative coefficient (phase + saddle-point over the sum) stays the classical interface.
- **The Bombieri–Lagarias pipeline + Li's criterion, both directions** (`Square/BLPipeline.lean`) —
  `Rnonneg_Rlim` (non-negativity passes to a Bishop limit) is the new constructive core. `BLZeroSum`
  carries the BL zero-sum representation and the on-line unit-modulus fact as explicit hypotheses;
  `bl_rh_implies_liNonneg` is the forward direction `RH ⟹ LiNonneg(genuineLamSeq)`. `LiBridge` adds
  the Voros dichotomy (a constructive `∨`, choice-free — grounded as an *asymptotic* theorem,
  Voros/Lagarias + the `n ≳ T²/t` threshold); `liNonneg_implies_onLine` is the reverse; `li_criterion`
  is the full equivalence `LiNonneg(genuineLamSeq) ⟺ AllZerosOnLine`. Both classical inputs are
  explicit `LiBridge` fields, audit-visible; the equivalence is axiom-clean.
- **The constructive Cayley transform — the `onLine_unit` leg DISCHARGED** (`Analysis/CayleyMap.lean`,
  `Square/BLPipeline.lean`). The BL pipeline had carried the on-line unit-modulus fact `|1−1/ρ|² = 1`
  as an explicit `BLZeroSum` hypothesis; it is not independent content — it is forced by the Li
  growth-ratio geometry. `CayleyMap.lean` builds the genuine map `liRatio ρ = (ρ−1)·(1/ρ)` over the
  constructive complex reciprocal (`Cinv`) and proves its modulus law: `cnormSq_recip`
  (`|ρ|²·|1/ρ|² = 1`, from `Cmul_Cinv` through `cnormSq_mul`, no explicit `Rinv` algebra) and
  `cnormSq_liRatio_on_line` (`Re ρ = ½ ⟹ |liRatio ρ|² = 1`, via `liRatio_on_line`). `blZeroSum_ofZeros`
  then builds a `BLZeroSum` from genuine zero data with `onLine_unit` **derived**, not assumed — so the
  BL interface is shrunk to its irreducible classical core (the explicit-formula zero-sum `bl` + its
  convergence `reg`); `bl_rh_implies_liNonneg_ofZeros` is the forward direction from that shrunk
  interface. No `sqrt`, choice-free.
- **The per-zero Li contribution, linearized — the explicit-formula framework's algebraic core**
  (`Analysis/LiLinearize.lean`). `cone_sub_npow_factor` — the geometric factorization
  `1 − wⁿ = (1−w)·Σ_{k<n} wᵏ` for complex `w`, by induction; with `w = 1−1/ρ` (`liRatio`), `1−w = 1/ρ`,
  so it exhibits the first moment `1/ρ` as an explicit factor of every per-zero Li contribution.
  `witnessTerm_eq_linear` — the real part: the `RHWitness` per-zero term
  `1 − Re(wⁿ) = Re((1−w)·Σ_{k<n} wᵏ)`; `witnessSum_eq_linear` lifts it to the pipeline object,
  `witnessSum ws n = Σ_w Re((1−w)·Σ_{k<n} wᵏ)` (the sum the BL `bl` interface equates to `λₙ`).
  Summed over zeros this expresses `λₙ` through the power moments
  `Σ_ρ ρ^{−k}`; that those moments equal the `−ζ′/ζ` Taylor data `ηⱼ` plus the archimedean place (the
  explicit formula / Hadamard factorization) stays the classical interface. Also adds the small complex
  commutative-ring lemmas the substrate had not yet needed (`cmul_czero`, `cadd_zero`, `cmul_cneg`, the
  local congruences) — reusable for any future complex algebra. No zeros placed, no positivity asserted.
- **The closed-disk witness hypothesis IS RH (set-level closure)** (`Analysis/Reflection.lean`,
  `Square/BLPipeline.lean`). `rh_witness_onLine` carried, in prose, that the half-plane (closed Cayley
  disk) witness does not secretly weaken RH; this upgrades it to a theorem. `double_inj` — doubling is
  injective (`x+x = y+y ⟹ x = y`, the constructive "divide by 2" via `half_double`); `onLine_of_ratios_eq`
  / `onLine_iff_ratios_eq` — the converse of `liRatio_on_line` (`|ρ−1|² = |ρ|² ⟹ Re ρ = ½`), so unit
  Cayley modulus is EQUIVALENT to being on the line; `ReflClosed` + `allInClosedDisk_iff_allOnLine` —
  for a reflection-closed zero set, "every Cayley factor in the closed disk" (the witness hypothesis)
  ⟺ `AllZerosOnLine`. Composed in `li_criterion_disk`: `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n ⟺ every zero's Cayley factor lies in
  the closed unit disk` — Li's criterion in the witness's own geometry, the most natural geometric
  phrasing of RH on this substrate.
- **RH stated about the constructed ζ** (`Analysis/RiemannZero.lean`) — `NontrivialZero` bundles a
  strip point with its `CzetaStrip` convergence certificate and a vanishing proof, making the genuine
  zero set a clean predicate (`isZeroOfZeta`); `RiemannHypothesisStrip := ∀ Z, Re Z.s = ½` is RH for
  the ζ this repo builds, formalized as the open statement it is; `riemannHypothesisStrip_iff` ties it
  to the pipeline's `AllZerosOnLine`.
- **The arithmetic Hodge index ⟺ RH** (`Square/AtlasAnalyticFace.lean`) — `hodgeIndex_iff_RH`:
  `SpectralHodgeNeg(𝕊) ⟺ AllZerosOnLine` (via `genuine_hodgeNeg_iff` + `li_criterion`);
  `hodgeIndex_iff_riemannHypothesis`: `SpectralHodgeNeg(𝕊) ⟺ RiemannHypothesisStrip` — the F1-square
  Hodge index equated end to end to RH about the constructed ζ. `atlas_coupling_analytic_face` bundles
  the geometric and analytic faces. `hodgeIndex_iff_closedDisk` (this release): the same Hodge index ⟺
  every zero's Cayley factor in the closed unit disk (via `li_criterion_disk`) — so the geometric
  Hodge index, Li-positivity, the on-line condition, and the witness's closed-disk geometry are ONE
  connected proposition.
- **Track 1 — ★ REAL log-multiplicativity `Rlog(x·y) = Rlog x + Rlog y`** (`Analysis/ArtanhAdd.lean`,
  `Rlog_mul`), what `Clog` additivity needs (`Re Clog(zw) = Re Clog z + Re Clog w` via
  `log(|z|²|w|²) = log|z|² + log|w|²`). The full binary analog of the doubling `Rlog_sq`, built from
  scratch over many bricks: the rational addition law (below) → the sign-robust division-free addition
  map `wvalR a b = (a+b)/(1+ab)` with its full Lipschitz machinery (`wval_lip1`/`wval_lip2` via the
  certified cleared identities + the constant-`4` denominator estimate `wval_lip1_den` and radius
  half-bound `wval_halfbound`) → the two rational identities `wvalR_rel` and `tmap_mul_wvalR`
  (`tmap(x·y) = wvalR(tmap x, tmap y)`, the bridge `log(xy)↔` the addition map) → the real binary map
  `wvalReal` with regularity → the ★ **capstone** `Rartanh_add_real_via` (the real-argument `artanh`
  addition, binary analog of `Rartanh_double_real_via`: the doubling's single-variable polynomial bound
  `Dterm_recip` has *no* binary analog, so its combination leg is the exact rational law itself,
  `RartanhConst_add_wval_rho`, which inherently relates the depth-`n` `wval` to the depth-`(2n+1)`
  summands; arg-variation by `artSum_wval_argdiff`) → the wiring `Rlog_mul_via`/`Rlog_mul_algebra` →
  `Rlog_mul`, mirroring `Rlog_sq`'s radius bookkeeping (common bound `B`, `x,y ∈ [1,B]` *pointwise* so
  the `artanh` arguments `tmap(·)` are non-negative — `tmap_nonneg_lt_one`; `hbw` via
  `wvalR_tmap_seq_bound`; radius alignment `ρ_B → ρ_{B²}` via `Rartanh_radius_indep`). RH-independent
  interface-shrinking toward `bl`; the crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1 — the real `arctan` addition map `vvalReal = (s+t)/(1−s·t)`** (`Analysis/ArtanhAdd.lean`),
  the argument-addition substrate for `Clog`'s imaginary half (`arg(zw) = arg z + arg w`). The full
  `arctan` analog of the `wval`/`artanh` Lipschitz stack: the division-free map `vval a b` with its
  cleared one-sided differences (`vval_argdiff1`/`vval_argdiff2`, factor `1+c²` vs `artanh`'s `1−c²`),
  the radius half-bound `vval_halfbound` (denominator `1−ac`), the strengthened `2c² ≤ 1`
  (`vval_csq_le`, which the `arctan` Lipschitz core needs vs `artanh`'s `c² ≤ 1`), symmetry `vval_comm`,
  inner-positivity `vval_inner_pos` (`1−ab > 0`), the binary Lipschitz bounds `vval_lip1`/`vval_lip2`
  (constant `6`, vs `artanh`'s `4`, on the certified denominator estimate `vval_lip1_den`), and the real
  map `vvalReal` with regularity (`12n+11` reindex absorbing the two Lipschitz-`6` terms, since
  `12·Qbound(12n+11) = Qbound n`). RH-independent; the crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1 — ★ the formal identity `sin∘arctan = t·(cos∘arctan)`** (`Analysis/ArctanODE.lean`,
  `sin_arctan_eq`), the formal-power-series shadow of `tan(arctan t) = t` (the sole remaining gap for
  argument-additivity). A complete constructive formal-PS ODE toolkit, built from scratch on the
  `fderiv`/`fmul`/`fcomp` calculus (`ExpLog.lean`): the `sin`/`cos` coefficient ODEs
  (`sin_fderiv : sin′=cos`, `cos_fderiv : cos′=−sin`), the composition chain-rule ODEs
  (`sinComp_deriv : (sin∘arctan)′=(cos∘arctan)·A′`, `cosComp_deriv : (cos∘arctan)′=−(sin∘arctan)·A′`,
  via `fcomp_chain`), the convolution evaluators (`fmul_Xident : (t·H)(k+1)=H(k)`,
  `fmul_onePlusSq : ((1+t²)·H)(k+2)=H(k+2)+H(k)`, `onePlusSq_geomAlt : (1+t²)·A′=1`,
  `absorb_onePlusSq_geomAlt : (1+t²)·(P·A′)=P`, `X_sq_eq_sq2 : X²=t²`), and the **formal ODE-uniqueness
  lemma** `ode_unique` (the discrete `(1+t²)H′=t·H ∧ H(0)=0 ⟹ H=0`, via the coefficient recurrence
  `(k+3)H(k+3)=−k·H(k+1)` and a triple-invariant induction). The capstone applies `ode_unique` to
  `G = sin∘arctan − t·(cos∘arctan)`: `Gseq_ode` shows `(1+t²)G′ = t·G` (both sides collapse to the
  common form `X·S − t²·C`), `Gseq_zero` gives `G(0)=0`, so `G ≈ 0`. **Finding:** this is the formal
  half; lifting it to the value identity `Rsin(arctan t) = t·Rcos(arctan t)` needs the composition-series
  value bridge (convergence/rearrangement, template `Rartanh_double_real_via`/`dcomp_artSum`). RH-*independent*
  analytic infrastructure; crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1 — the formal `arctan` ODE `A′(t) = 1/(1+t²)`** (`Analysis/ArctanODE.lean`), the
  alternating sibling of `dgeom_ode`: the arctan coefficient sequence `arctanCoeff` has formal
  derivative `fderiv arctanCoeff = geomAlt` (`arctan_fderiv`, the `1/(1+t²)` coefficients), with the
  `(1+t²)`-annihilation `geomAlt(k+2) + geomAlt(k) ≈ 0` (`geomAlt_recurrence`) and boundary
  `geomAlt 0 = 1`, `geomAlt 1 = 0`. Built on the `fderiv`/`fmul` formal-power-series calculus
  (`ExpLog.lean`). **Finding (sharp diagnosis):** unlike the `artanh` exp engine — whose geometric
  series is *exactly rational-summable* to `(1+w)/(1−w)`, giving an exact value identity — the `arctan`
  series is *not* rational-summable, so this formal ODE does **not** collapse to a value identity. The
  one remaining gap for argument-addition (hence `Clog`'s imaginary half) is precisely the value-level
  inverse-function fact `tan(arctan t) = t` (equivalently `Rsin(arctan t) = t·Rcos(arctan t)`); the
  `vval` algebra, `Rsin_add`/`Rcos_add`, and `Rcos_sq_add_sin_sq` are all already in place around it, so
  only the formal-PS → value (fundamental-theorem-of-calculus) bridge — seeded by `arctan_fderiv` —
  remains. RH-*independent* analytic infrastructure; the crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1 — the rational `artanh` addition law** (`Analysis/ArtanhAdd.lean`), the arithmetic heart of
  log-multiplicativity `log(xy) = log x + log y` (hence of `Clog` additivity, hence of the Hadamard
  `log ξ`). `Rexp_twoArtanh_general` packages the heavy `Rexp_two_artanh_ofQ` parameter thicket **once**
  for an arbitrary rational `0 ≤ τ < 1` (the radius-`ρ = τ` analog of `Rexp_twoArtanhRecip`, now at a
  *general* base): with `τ = p/q`, `d = q−p`, the target `g = (q+p)/d = (1+τ)/(1−τ)` and the budget
  `C = (2L+4)q²` clears with slack `(2L+4)q²·d(j+1)²·(d−1) ≥ 0` — clean because `d ≥ 1` (two private
  `Int` lemmas `twoArtanhGen_hM2_int`/`_hBC_int`, the `ring_uor`-slack + `omega` pattern). Then
  `TwoArtanh_add_rat` proves `2·artanh c = 2·artanh a + 2·artanh b` for rationals `0 ≤ a,b,c < 1`,
  gated on the multiplicativity side-condition `(1+c)/(1−c) = ((1+a)/(1−a))·((1+b)/(1−b))` (which is
  exactly `c = (a+b)/(1+ab)`): three instances of `Rexp_twoArtanh_general` feed the exp-injectivity
  additivity core `Req_add_of_exp_values` (`RArctanCongr.lean`). With the continuity `RarctanR_congr`
  (rational→real lift) this is the route to real log-multiplicativity. `Rnonneg_TwoArtanhConst` records
  `2·artanh τ ≥ 0` for `τ ≥ 0`.
  - **`wval` — the division-free addition map** `(a+b)/(1+ab)` (numerator `pa·qb+pb·qa`, denominator
    `qa·qb+pa·pb`), with `wval_den_pos`/`wval_num_nonneg`/`wval_lt` (the last via the slack
    `(qa−pa)(qb−pb) > 0`, the `a,b < 1` margins) and the multiplicativity identity `wval_hg`
    (`(1+wval)/(1−wval) = ((1+a)/(1−a))·((1+b)/(1−b))`, both sides clearing to
    `(qa+pa)(qb+pb)(qa−pa)(qb−pb)` — a pure-`Int` `ring_uor` identity once the `Nat.cast`/`toNat`
    bridges are discharged). `TwoArtanh_add_wval` then gives the addition law in directly-usable form
    `2·artanh(wval a b) = 2·artanh a + 2·artanh b` with the `hg` side-condition discharged once and the
    sum-argument `c = wval a b` computed — leaving only trivial positivity obligations for callers.
  - **Binary Lipschitz core for the real lift** (`wval_argdiff1_cleared`/`wval_argdiff2_cleared`,
    `wvalR`/`wvalR_den_pos`/`wvalR_argdiff1`/`wvalR_argdiff2`). Structural finding: the unary doubling
    lift `Rartanh_double_real_via` works through a *single-variable* polynomial composition
    (`dcomp_artSum`/`peval (fcomp acoef kdbl)`), which binary addition lacks — so its real lift needs a
    genuine two-variable continuity argument over a sign-robust binary map. The certified algebraic
    heart: each one-sided variation of `(s+t)/(1+st)` factors as `(Δ-cross)·(1 − other²)` — pure-`Int`
    `ring_uor` identities, the analog of `uval_diff_cleared`. The sign-robust real-map basis `wvalR`
    (the *whole* `1+ab` numerator under `.toNat`, positive for `|a|,|b| < 1`, unlike `wval` which is
    `≥0`-only) is wired to those identities by `wvalR_argdiff1`/`_argdiff2`: the `Qsub` numerator of a
    one-sided map difference equals `(Qsub a b).num·(qc²−pc²)` resp. `(Qsub c d).num·(qa²−pa²)`.
  - **The binary Lipschitz bound** `|wvalR a c − wvalR b c| ≤ 4·|a − b|` (`wval_lip1`), the analog of
    `uval_lip` for the addition map. Its certified cores: `wval_lip1_den` (the constant-`4` denominator
    estimate `(qc²−pc²)·qa·qb ≤ 4·D(a,c)·D(b,c)`, via `(qa·qc)(qb·qc) ≤ (2D_ac)(2D_bc)`), `wval_halfbound`
    (the radius half-bound `qa·qc ≤ 2(qa·qc+pa·pc)` from `|a|,|c| ≤ ρ`, `ρ² ≤ ½` — the small-radius the
    unary doubling also needed), and `wval_csq_le` (`|c| < 1`, i.e. `pc² ≤ qc²`, from the radius). The
    wrapper composes `wvalR_argdiff1` (numerator `(a−b)(1−c²)`) over the denominator estimate via
    `n·d ≤ n·e` (`n = |a−b|`-cross). (The `wvalReal` regularity and the two-variable diagonal addition
    build on this.)
  RH-independent interface-shrinking toward discharging `bl`; the crux fields stay `none`.
- **Track 1, brick 1 — arctan at a general REAL argument** (`Analysis/RArctan.lean`). The forced-first
  prerequisite of the `Γ(s/2) → ξ → Hadamard` stack that discharges the `bl` seam: complex `Clog` on
  the right half-plane needs `arg(z) = arctan(Im z / Re z)` at a general real ratio, and the repo had
  only rational-argument `Rarctan` (truncation-only). `RarctanR t ρ` lifts arctan to a real argument
  (`|t| ≤ ρ < 1`), mirroring the real-argument `Rartanh`: since `arctanTerm t n = (−1)ⁿ·artTerm t n`,
  the sign vanishes under `Qabs`, so `arctanTerm_diff_bound`, `arctanSum_Lip_le`, and the diagonal
  `RarctanR_diag_le` reuse the shared sign-independent machinery (`Rartanh_R`, `geoEvenSum`,
  `geoEven_bound`, `artanh_reindex`, `qpow_geom_bound`, `arctanSum_trunc`). RH-independent
  interface-shrinking toward discharging `bl`; the crux fields stay `none`.
- **Burnol's correction — the sharpest UNCONDITIONAL Weil-positivity mechanism** (`Square/SonineProjection.lean`).
  A deep-research survey (101 agents, 3-vote adversarial verification) identified the sharpest
  unconditional (NOT RH-equivalent) Weil-positivity theorem: Burnol's support-restricted positivity
  (arXiv math/0101068). Since `α(τ) → +∞` at `±∞` the negative band is bounded, so `∃Aε>0` with
  `Aε·cos(ετ) + α(τ) ≥ 0 ∀τ`, and `cos(ετ)` integrates to zero on the window `[1/c,c]` —
  positivity recovered on the window, unconditionally. Discretized here: `multForm_psd_via_correction`
  (a correction making the multiplier pointwise `≥0` and vanishing on the support of the test family
  ⟹ the pairing is `≥0`, unconditional), and the Burnol instance `burnolCorr` /
  `burnol_corrected_nonneg` (the `α(2)<0` band lifted to `α(2)+(−α(2))=0`, the corrected multiplier
  pointwise nonneg) / `burnol_pairing_psd_via_correction` (window positivity via the correction).
  The unconditional ceiling is the single archimedean place; full positivity (the multi-place /
  `f↔f̂` coupling) is RH and stays open. (Verified context: Connes–Consani Selecta 2021 single-place
  bound `W∞ ≥ Tr(ϑ(g)Sϑ(g)*) − c|ĝ(0)|²`, `c=4γ/log2`; the precise gap is the Beurling
  inner-function condition — the ratio-of-local-factors multipliers are not inner.)
- **The Sonine projection — Weil positivity recovered on the band complement**
  (`Square/SonineProjection.lean`). The crux frontier, formalized. With the natural finite routes
  foreclosed (component isolation RH-equivalent; pointwise single-place positivity refuted; free SOS
  for `2λₙ` = RH), what is left standing is a PROJECTION: positivity of the *whole* Weil pairing
  recovered on the Sonine complement (Connes–Consani / Burnol). Extrapolated from the proven
  α-indefiniteness and the Atlas signature geometry: `multForm α` is the discrete Weil multiplier form
  `Σ_τ α(τ)|g(τ)|²` diagonalized; `weilQuad_multForm` collapses it to `Σ_i c_i² α(i)` (via `RsumN_sift`);
  `multForm_psd_iff` — the whole form is PSD ⟺ the multiplier has no negative band; and the load-bearing
  **`multForm_psd_on_complement`** — UNCONDITIONALLY, if the test family vanishes on the negative band,
  the pairing is `≥ 0` (positivity recovered on the Sonine complement, a theorem, no RH). The Burnol
  instance (`burnol_pairing_indefinite` / `burnol_pairing_psd_on_sonine` / `burnol_sonine_dichotomy`):
  the bare pairing is indefinite (the `α(2)<0` band is real), but projecting off the band (`c(1)=0`)
  recovers positivity via `α(0)>0`. What is unconditional (band-complement positivity) vs what is RH
  (extending it to the whole space via the genuine Sonine `f↔f̂` coupling) is now explicit. Crux `none`.
- **The Burnol multiplier is indefinite — pointwise single-place positivity REFUTED**
  (`Analysis/BurnolAlphaTwo.lean`). `α(0) > 0` (`burnolAlphaZero_pos`, window center) and `α(2) < 0`
  (`burnolAlphaTwo_neg`, off-center) were both proven; this packages the frontier statement they
  jointly establish. `burnol_multiplier_indefinite` — the bare archimedean multiplier takes both
  signs; `burnolAlphaSample` + `burnolAlpha_not_pointwise_nonneg` / `burnolAlpha_not_pointwise_nonpos`
  — on its computed samples it is neither everywhere `≥ 0` nor everywhere `≤ 0`, so pointwise
  single-place positivity is refuted (both directions). The Connes–Consani / Burnol Sonine-space
  projection (positivity after projecting onto the prime-free window), NOT a pointwise `α ≥ 0`, is the
  genuine Track-2 resolution; the obstruction (Burnol "a further idea seems necessary") is now a named
  theorem. Crux fields stay `none`.
- **The prime-free window is maximal** (`Square/Pairing.lean`) — `prime_window_maximal`: the conquered
  prime-free window is at `X = 1`; the prime `2` enters at the next term (`Λ(2) = log 2`), the discrete
  Connes–Consani interval `(1/2, 2)`.
- **The atlas spectral signature** (`Square/AtlasSpectrum.lean`) — `atlasM_signature`: signature
  `(10,14)`; `atlasM_not_hodge_signature`: ten positive directions ≠ the Hodge form's one, so the
  spectral operator is structurally distinct from the crux's intersection form.
- **Literature reconnaissance — the frontier, sourced (2020–2026 survey, adversarially verified).** A
  deep multi-source survey (102 agents, 3-vote verification per claim) confirms the program's honest
  frontier with citations: **every** Li/Keiper-coefficient positivity statement is *exactly equivalent
  to RH* — Li's criterion `RH ⟺ λₙ ≥ 0` (Bombieri–Lagarias 1999; Lagarias, *Ann. Inst. Fourier* 57,
  2007; Selberg class, Mazhouda 2015; model-space/de Branges reformulation, Suzuki 2023, arXiv
  2301.05779) — so there is **no known unconditional bridge** to global positivity. The off-line ⟹
  `λₙ < 0` step is *asymptotic*, via steepest descents/Darboux on a superzeta integral (Voros, arXiv
  1403.4558 / 2204.01036 / math/0404213), with the violation regime astronomically far out (`n ≳ T²/t
  ≈ 10²⁵` given RH verified to `T₀ ≈ 2.4·10¹²`) — confirming the `LiBridge.dichotomy` grounding. The
  ONLY unconditional positivity is the **single archimedean-place** Weil positivity (Connes–Consani,
  *Selecta* 2021, arXiv 2006.13771) — the prime-free Sonine window, which this repo formalizes as
  `prime_window_maximal` / `archimedean_center_positive`; its semi-local generalization *implies* RH
  (no unconditional route), CC noting an obstruction (non-monotonic Riemann–Siegel angle). Net: the
  crux's open content is genuinely-new mathematics, and the unconditional boundary is exactly the
  single-place window already implemented here. Crux fields stay `none`.
- **The Riemann–Siegel angle obstruction, formalized** (`Analysis/RiemannSiegel.lean`) — the survey's
  named barrier to the single-place → semi-local extension, made an axiom-clean theorem. The
  Riemann–Siegel angle `θ(t) = arg Γ(1/4 + i t/2) − (t/2)·log π` (the phase of the completed-ζ
  functional equation) has center slope `θ′(0) = ½·(ψ(1/4) − log π)`, and `rsCenterSlope_neg :
  Pos (Rneg rsCenterSlope)` proves it strictly negative — `ψ(1/4) < log π`, so `θ` *decreases* through
  the symmetry point `t = 0`. This non-monotonicity is exactly the obstruction Connes–Consani note to
  a monotonicity-based propagation of the single-archimedean-place positivity across further places.
  The proof uses `psiQuarter_upper` (`ψ(1/4) ≤ −3`, the value bounded *above* — the opposite direction
  to the α(0) certificate, whose `psiQuarter_lower` bounds it below) and `Rnonneg_Rlogπc` (`log π ≥ 0`,
  via `Rnonneg_Rartanh_of_nonneg` on the repo's canonical `Rlogπc = 2·artanh((π−1)/(π+1))`, the same
  `log π` of α(0)/λ₁/λ₂). The **obstruction formalized faithfully — not a route through it**.
- **The archimedean kernel `Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2)` ASSEMBLED, and the angle is non-monotone two-sidedly**
  (`Analysis/PsiLine.lean`) — a large construction. `DigammaWindow.lean` had built the `τ`-parameterized
  kernel *term* and its monotonicity but not the assembled kernel; this builds it at the frontier point
  `τ = 10` (`s = τ²/4 = 25`), the first value of `Re ψ` along the critical line off the center `ψ(1/4)`.
  The window term splits exactly as `windowTerm n 25 = windowTerm n 0 + cₙ`,
  `cₙ = 1600/[(4n+1)((4n+1)²+400)] ≥ 0` (`corrT_eq_windowTerm_gain`, the faithfulness bridge to
  `DigammaWindow`), so `Re ψ(1/4 + 5i) = ψ(1/4) + Σ cₙ`. `corrCore` is `Σ cₙ` as a **genuine
  constructive real** — a manifestly positive convergent series, with regularity proved *from scratch*
  via the telescoping `cₙ ≤ tel(n) − tel(n+1)`, `tel(n) = 100/(4n+1)`, holding for all `n` through the
  manifest square `(4n−1)² + 380 ≥ 0` (depth schedule `j ↦ 25(j+1)`). `psiLineRe5 := ψ(1/4) + corrCore`,
  with lower bracket `psiLineRe5_lower : Re ψ(1/4 + 5i) ≥ 1.28` (true value `≈ 1.61`) from
  `psiQuarter_lower` and `corrCore_lower` (`Σ cₙ ≥ 5.6`, the certified 12-term partial sum). Consequence:
  `rsLineSlope10_pos : θ′(10) > 0` (`Re ψ(1/4+5i) > log π`, using `Rlogπc_le`), and the capstone
  `rsAngle_non_monotone : θ′(0) < 0 ∧ θ′(10) > 0` — for one `θ` (one `log π = Rlogπc`), the slope changes
  sign, so the Riemann–Siegel angle is **non-monotone, two-sided**: the bounded-negative-band structure
  Burnol / Connes–Consani must work around. The obstruction completed as a theorem; it sharpens the
  barrier, it does not cross it. Crux fields stay `none`.
- **The kernel parameterized, and the monotone climb (θ convex on the window)** (`Analysis/PsiLine.lean`)
  — `corrCoreP sn sd` / `psiLineReP sn sd` assemble `Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2) = ψ(1/4) + Σ cₙ(s)` for *every*
  rational `s = τ²/4 = sn/sd ∈ [0, 25]`, not just `s = 25`. The key reductions are exact: `cₙ` is
  monotone in `s` with `cₙ(s) ≤ cₙ(25) ⟺ sn ≤ 25·sd` (each divides out `(4n+1)³`), so the `s = 25`
  telescoping dominates every `s ≤ 25` uniformly — the *same* depth schedule `j ↦ 25(j+1)` gives
  regularity for all of them, and the climb is then a termwise comparison. `psiLineReP_mono`:
  `s ≤ s' ⟹ Re ψ(1/4 + i√s) ≤ Re ψ(1/4 + i√s')` — `Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2)` is **monotone increasing in `τ`**,
  the analytic heart `DigammaWindow` recorded, now a theorem about the *assembled* kernel. Combined with
  `rsAngle_non_monotone`, the slope `θ′ = ½(Re ψ − log π)` is monotone increasing from `θ′(0) < 0` to
  `θ′(10) > 0` — so `θ` is **convex on the window with a unique minimum**, and the negative-`α` band is a
  single bounded interval. The obstruction's exact shape, made a theorem; crux fields stay `none`.
- **`θ′ > 0` on the whole upper band** (`Analysis/PsiLine.lean`) — `rsAngle_increasing_on_band`: for
  *every* rational `s = τ²/4 ∈ [16, 25]`, `θ′ > 0` (`Re ψ(1/4 + i√s) > log π`). The monotone climb
  carries a single sharper positive point — `rsLineSlope16_pos : θ′(8) > 0` (`Re ψ(1/4 + 4i) ≥ 1.18`
  from `ψ(1/4) ≥ −4.32` and the certified `Σ cₙ(16) ≥ 5.5`) — to the entire interval `s ≥ 16`. So the
  Riemann–Siegel angle's unique minimum sits at `τ < 8`, and beyond it `θ` rises monotonically: a genuine
  interval of positivity, not a single point. (`corrCoreP_ge_partial` generalizes the partial-sum lower
  bracket to any cutoff `N ≤ 25`.) Crux fields stay `none`.
- **The kernel reduces to `ψ(1/4)` at the center** (`Analysis/PsiLine.lean`) — `psiLineReP_zero`:
  `Re ψ(1/4 + i·0) = ψ(1/4)`, the assembled-level analog of `DigammaWindow.windowTerm_zero` (`corrCoreP_zero`:
  `Σ cₙ(0) = 0`, every `s=0` correction term vanishes). With `psiLineRe5 = psiLineReP 25 1` at the far end,
  the parameterized assembled kernel is now verified-correct at **both endpoints** of the window — a
  faithfulness anchor closing the construction. Crux fields stay `none`.
- **`α(2) < 0` — Burnol's archimedean multiplier is pointwise INDEFINITE** (`Analysis/BurnolAlphaTwo.lean`,
  with a new lower-bound substrate). The bare multiplier `α(τ) = 8√2·cos(τ·log2)/(1+4τ²) + h₊(τ)`,
  `h₊(τ) = Re ψ(1/4+iτ/2) − log π`, is shown **negative at `τ = 2`** (`burnolAlphaTwo_neg :
  Pos (Rneg burnolAlphaTwo)`) — the honest kernel analog of Burnol's "a further idea seems necessary":
  single-place positivity does *not* extend across the band, which is exactly why the Sonine projection
  is needed. We prove the **obstruction**, never a (false) `α ≥ 0`. The pieces, all axiom-clean
  (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), each its own bracket added to the substrate:
  - `Rpi_lower_three : π ≥ 3` (`Analysis/Pi.lean`) — sharp `π` *lower* bound via depth-parameterized
    arctan brackets (`arctanSum_diag_ge_at`/`_le_at`, tail `ρ^(2a+3)`); the repo had only `π ≤ …`.
  - `Rlogpi_ge_one : log π ≥ 1` (`Analysis/LogPiLower.lean`) — `log π = 2·artanh((π−1)/(π+1)) ≥ 2·½`,
    resting on `π ≥ 3`; the first positive *lower* bound on a log in the substrate (companion to
    `Rlogπc_le`).
  - `psiQuarter_upper_tight : ψ(1/4) ≤ −4` (`Analysis/PsiQuarter.lean`) — the sharp upper bracket
    (a two-branch `n<6` / `n≥6` Int case split on the digamma series).
  - `corrCoreP_one_upper : Σ cₙ(1) ≤ 4.22`, `psiLineReP_one_upper : Re ψ(1/4+i) ≤ 0.22`,
    `archKernel_at_two_below_logpi : Pos (Rsub Rlogπc (psiLineReP 1 1 …))` — i.e. `h₊(2) < 0`
    (`Analysis/PsiLine.lean`), from `Re ψ(1/4+i) = ψ(1/4) + Σcₙ(1) ≤ −4 + 4.22 = 0.22` and `log π ≥ 1`.
  - `sqrt2_mul_self : √2·√2 = 2` and `sqrt2_le_three_halves : √2 ≤ 3/2` (`Analysis/BurnolAlphaTwo.lean`)
    — the **exp∘log inverse** (`RrpowPos_add` + `Rexp_RlogNat`), no `sqrt` primitive.
  Assembled: with `|cos| ≤ 1`, `8√2 ≤ 12` and `1/(1+16) = 1/17` bound the oscillating term by `12/17`,
  so `α(2) ≤ 12/17 + (0.22 − 1) = 12/17 − 78/100 = 126/1700` negated, i.e. `−α(2) ≥ 1/100 > 0`. The
  obstruction to extending single-place positivity, mechanized at a point. Crux fields stay `none`.
- **Erratum** — corrected the stale `λ₃ ≈ 0.0173` / `λ₃^∞ ≈ −1.20` (a computational error) to the
  standard Li value `λ₃ ≈ 0.2076` / `λ₃^∞ ≈ −1.013` across `LambdaThree.lean`, `CruxFrontierN3.lean`,
  `Attempt.lean`, `ROADMAP.md`, and the v0.20.0 changelog entry; recorded the precision analysis (the
  binding constraint is `γ₁`, not `γ`; six constants need ~0.1–0.3% relative precision).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-16

Stage G — the arithmetic Hodge-index crux via the missing-object embedding, and the UOR Atlas
formalized. **Outcome: LOCALIZED** — the route is built end to end and the Atlas is formalized to
its frontier, but the crux did not close; `hodgeIndexHolds` / `liPositivityHolds` stay `none`,
RH OPEN. Every commit green, axiom-clean `{propext, Quot.sound}`, no `sorry`/`native_decide`.

### Added — the embedding route
- `Square/WeilPSD.lean` — the finite-truncation PSD predicate `WeilPSD`; `WeilPSD_rankOne` (a
  rank-one Gram is the manifest square); `WeilPSD_gramOf` (Gate B free for any embedding into ℝ^D);
  the embedding bridge `embeds_to_hodgeNeg` / `realizesDiag_genuine_iff`.
- `Square/FrobForm.lean` — the full primitive form `FullForm` on the Frobenius carrier; the
  diagonal forced to `−2λₙ`; `negPSD_to_hodgeNeg`; a non-trivial shift-length off-diagonal.
- `Square/AtlasRule.lean` — the zero-free `AtlasRule`; `atlasRule_growth_filter`; **`cayley_relocation`**
  (the §6 recorded negative result: a zero-built candidate's match ⟺ RH).
- `Square/KillTest.lean` — the decidable finite-Gram kill-test (throwaway pre-filter).
- `Square/GateA.lean` — the λ-free pairing `atlasPair`; `gateA_is_liNonneg` (Gate A under free
  Gate B is RH); two-sided no-smuggling guards (`gateA_satisfiable`, `gateA_can_fail`).
- `Square/E8Seed.lean` — the E₈ Gram as an embedding Gram (PSD free), verified `= 4×` the standard
  E₈ Cartan matrix (`e8_is_cartan`), strictly positive diagonal.
- `Square/GaugeTower.lean` — the gauge tower carrying a metric; `not_WeilPSD_of_neg_diag` and the
  make-or-break obstruction `limit_indefinite_of_neg_signature`.
- `Square/StageG.lean` — `stageG_frontier_located` (the adjudication); the **conditional closure**
  `strictRealizes_closes_crux` / `strictRealizes_is_liCrux`.
- `Square/GateSanity.lean` — `crux_gate_faithful`: the crux gate discriminates and **closes on a
  genuine witness** (it does not arbitrarily fail).

### Added — the UOR Atlas (from the `uor-atlas.md` formalization document)
- `Square/AtlasSpectrum.lean` — the spectral operator `M = (O+2)I − T·Π_T − O·Π_O` (§5/§6.6),
  sourcing `Σ = {10,2,7,−1}`; verified multiplicities `{1,2,7,14}` and trace `24`; `atlasM_indefinite`;
  the Hurwitz norm `atlasNorm_psd` (a different, definite object — §9).
- `Square/AtlasCharacteristics.lean` — the convergence tower (§1), the Euler–Lefschetz
  self-intersection `χ(Sᵏ)=1+(−1)ᵏ` vanishing at the process levels (§11), the spectral balance
  (§5), and the §10 connections (`dim G₂ = 14`, `24 = dim E₈^T`, `θ_{E₈}=E₄`).
- `Square/AtlasAddressing.lean` — the addressing inverse system (§5), parametric generation (§8),
  and the prime skeleton = explicit-formula prime side `Λ(p)=log p` (§10/§12).
- `Square/AtlasClasses.lean` — the class structure (§2) and the transforms `σ,τ,μ` as finite-order
  class permutations (§3).
- `Square/AtlasConservation.lean` — no-loss, round-trip identity, scale-invariance (§4/§5).

### Added — Atlas discovery program (exploration; following discoveries to their next threads)
- `Square/AtlasForcing.lean` — what makes a value NOT a coincidence: parametric identity
  (`multSum_eq_dim`: dimension `= T·O` for all `T,O`) or over-determination; the discovery
  `trace_eq_dim_at_T3` (trace = dimension forced by the extremal `T = 3`).
- `Square/AtlasRHConnection.lean` — `atlas_shift_eq_weight` (addressing prime ↔ Frobenius orbit ↔
  `Λ(p)=log p`); `atlas_feeds_rh` (three live points where the Atlas feeds the RH program).
- `Square/LefschetzCoupling.lean` — the crux refined to its Lefschetz shape: `H² > 0`
  (`eH_sq_pos`), `vanCyc` primitive (`vanCyc_perp_H`), and `genuine_crux_arch_coupling` (crux ⟺
  sign of the prime–archimedean coupling `arith(n)+arch(n)`, the `ff_hodge_iff_hasse` shape over ℤ).
- `Square/ArchimedeanPlace.lean` — the `arch(n)` facet: conquered at the head (`n=1,2`) and in the
  Connes–Consani window (`α(0) > 0`); open outside (the tail bound).
- `Square/AtlasModular.lean` — `θ_{E₈^T} = E₄³ = E₆² + 1728·Δ` through order `q⁵` by power-series
  convolution; `Δ = η²⁴`, the `24 = dim E₈^T` = the modular `24`.
- `Square/AtlasExceptional.lean` — the Freudenthal–Tits magic square (`R,C,H,O → F₄,E₆,E₇,E₈`); the
  `dim 𝔤 = rank·(h+1)` law; `dim G₂ = (T−1)(O−1) = 14`; `240 = dim E₈ − rank E₈`.
- `Square/AtlasCoxeter.lean` — the E₈ exponents are the totatives of the Coxeter number `30`;
  `rank E₈ = φ(30) = 8 = O`; the `30/8/120/240/248` forced web.
- `Square/AtlasSynthesis.lean` — `atlas_forced_web`: every Atlas constant a function of `{T,O}=(3,8)`,
  no coincidences; `atlas_web_and_open_crux`: the honest boundary (the web does not force RH).
- `Square/AtlasCruxSynthesis.lean` — `atlas_crux_localization`: the Atlas forces the prime side, the
  crux is the prime–archimedean coupling sign, conquered at head + window, no shortcut.
- `Square/CruxFrontierN3.lean` — the next coefficient pinned: the `n=3` coupling `> 0 ⟺ Pos Rlambda3`.
- `Square/UniformClosure.lean` — closure is ONE structural fact, not enumeration (§2 thesis):
  `enumeration_insufficient` + `uniform_fact_closes`.
- `Square/CoxeterCandidate.lean` — a §7 named uniform-rule candidate (Coxeter iteration, order 30)
  tested and KILLED by the growth pre-filter (periodic ⟹ bounded ⟹ cannot match `2λₙ ~ n log n`).
- `Square/SinglePrime.lean` — the Single Prime Hypothesis: the Atlas as one Prime object emanating
  all structure (`single_generator_emanates`); unity ⟹ uniform closure.
- `Square/AtlasGenerator.lean` — the shift-length uniform-rule candidate `atlasShiftDiag`; survives
  the growth filter (unbounded `n log n` class) where Coxeter died.
- `Square/AtlasCoherence.lean` — coherence (the conserved zero-state) is the closure condition, not
  a single facet (`atlas_coherent`, `coherent_closure_not_single_facet`).
- `Square/AtlasComposition.lean` — the composition-algebra norm (§6.3/§9/§10): the 2-, 4-, 8-square
  identities (`two/four/eight_square`, Hurwitz) — Degen's octonion identity verified by `ring_uor`.
- `Square/AtlasTopology.lean` — the Betti signature (§6.5) and Bott/Clifford periodicity (§10); the
  tower forced four ways.
- `Square/AtlasCalculus.lean` — the seven operators, the free-monoid `Term`, and the catamorphism
  with its universal property (§3/§4): form determines function (`op_count`, `cata_unique`).
- `Square/AtlasComplete.lean` — `atlas_complete`: the roll-up witnessing every facet (§1–§15)
  formalized, as facets of one `{T,O}` object, with the crux honestly open.

### Changed
- `scripts/honesty_audit.sh` — new **no-smuggling** check (the metric analog of `intrinsicH1_dict`):
  the Gate-A pairing must be λ-free.
- `F1Square.lean` — v0.21.0 notes on the crux fields; a witness binding the stage-G route, crux none.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added — stage F: the UOR construction of the crux (`H¹`-object + FORCED dictionary) and the certified `γ₂ ≥ −0.02` bracket (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`, choice-free)

The v0.18.0 bridge carried the dictionary `⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ = −2λₙ` as INTERFACE DATA — a `SpectralSquare`
field that any instance supplied definitionally (`cSq := −2λ`, `dict := rfl`). Stage F removes
that assumption and **derives** the dictionary, mirroring `BridgeFF`'s dictionary column over ℤ: a
genuine rank-4 Néron–Severi-style lattice, the primitive projection with PROVEN orthogonality, and
the self-pairing computed from the Gram. **The gate then ran on the constructed object and LOCATED
THE FRONTIER** — the forced signature did *not* come out positive (proving `λₙ > 0 ∀n` *is* RH), so
the construction is complete down to one irreducible input (the genuine Stieltjes η-tail = the
zeros) and `hodgeIndexHolds`/`liPositivityHolds` stay `none` — the gate flips the instant a
faithful, axiom-clean proof of the criterion lands; until then **RH stays OPEN**. Stage F also
delivers the constructive second Stieltjes constant `γ₂` and **closes its numeric bracket
`γ₂ ≥ −0.02`** (`Rgamma2_ge_neg002`) — the documented open computational frontier from v0.18.0 — via
a discrete Euler–Maclaurin construction with a new Real "ring engine" (`RAddNF`+`RMulNF`); this is a
certified constant bound (evidence), NOT a positivity-of-all-`λₙ` (= RH) claim. Every theorem is
choice-free (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), audited; the build is warning-free; the gate passes.

- **A1 — the `H¹` carrier by universal property** (`F1Square/Square/Cohomology.lean`): a
  `FrobSys` is a carrier with a scaling/Frobenius action `φ` and a fundamental class `g`; the
  canonical `H¹` is `H1 = (ℕ, succ, 0)`, the **free / initial Frobenius system on one generator**
  — a morphism out of it is FORCED (`H1_universal`, `H1_isFree`, `freeFrob_unique_upto_iso`),
  exactly as the coproduct forced `𝕊` (v0.17.0). The Frobenius orbit **realizes the built
  prime-power pencil** as ONE equivariant identification (`orbit_realizes_pencil` — the orbit
  position's log-separation from the diagonal equals the built `pencil_separation_pow`;
  `orbitShift_succ` — each Frobenius step adds `log p = Λ(pᵏ)`, the Connes–Consani closed orbit).
  Honest scope: this builds the ABSTRACT carrier of the action, NOT the genuine spectral `H¹`
  (whose spectrum is the zeros) — that is the open frontier.
- **A2 — the intrinsic lattice and the trace datum** (`F1Square/Square/WeilLattice.lean`): `hPair`
  is the symmetric bilinear form on the rank-4 lattice `{F_h, F_v, Δ, Γ}` with the sourced/derived
  ruling intersections and the spectral data `Δ², Γ², Δ·Γ` as parameters. The vanishing cycle
  `Cₙ = Δ − Γₙ` is **proven GENUINELY PRIMITIVE** — orthogonal to both rulings for every spectral
  datum (`vanCyc_perp_Fh`, `vanCyc_perp_Fv`, the `BridgeFF.primDG_perp` analog) — not hand-picked.
  On `𝕊`'s coarse lattice the spectral data is `Δ²=Γ²=Δ·Γ=0` (pencil-blind, `vanCyc_blind`); the
  `H¹` enrichment lifts `Δ·Γₙ` to the explicit-formula value `λₙ`.
- **A3 — THE FORCED DICTIONARY**: the vanishing-cycle self-pairing is `Δ²−2(Δ·Γ)+Γ² = dd+gg−2dg`
  (`vanCyc_selfpair_gen`, the `BridgeFF.primDG_sq` analog), the `−2` being the lattice's own cross
  term. The geometric inputs `Δ²=Γ²=0` are **TIED to the v0.17.0 derived lattice**
  (`vanCyc_selfpair_built`, from `pair_diag_self_derived`/`pair_graph_self_derived`), not plugged.
  `IntrinsicH1` is **assumption-free by construction** — its only datum is `lam`; `cSq` is FORCED
  to the pairing diagonal, so no false dictionary CAN be inhabited; `intrinsicH1_dict` is a
  theorem. `genuineSpectralSquare` routes through it, so `⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ = −2λₙ` is now DERIVED
  (`genuineSpectralSquare_dict`), not a field — the v0.18.0 interface converted to construction.
- **B — the forced signature and the located frontier** (`F1Square/Square/Forced.lean`):
  `genuine_vanCyc_normal` (`−⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ = 2λₙ`, the completed-square normal form);
  `genuine_crux_equivalent` (the geometric crux on the constructed object ⟺ `LiCrux genuineLamSeq`
  = RH, now on an object whose dictionary is a theorem); `genuine_evidence_head` (`⟨C₁,C₁⟩ < 0`,
  `⟨C₂,C₂⟩ < 0` on the DERIVED object). **`genuine_crux_frontier_located` pins the FRONTIER** as
  one proposition: the forced criterion is exactly `∀n, Pos (genuineLamSeq n)`, the head `λ₁,λ₂`
  is discharged, no finite run reaches it (`genuine_iff_all_upTo`), and it is satisfiable
  (`genuine_signature_satisfiable`, no hidden impossibility) — the remaining input is the genuine
  Stieltjes η-tail (the zeros; the truncated `etaTwoSlice` is not it), and the gate flips the
  instant a faithful proof of the criterion lands. **Which
  `BridgeFF` column is done, which is open**: the DICTIONARY column (`primDG_sq`) is now a genuine
  theorem; the SIGNATURE-FORCING column (`ff_hodge_iff_hasse`, where the function field's `4q−a²`
  completed square forces the bound) has no unconditional analog over ℤ — the forced criterion is
  RH.
- **The roll-up** (`F1Square.lean`): the stage-F backing block and elaboration-checked witness
  (the carrier's universal property, the proven primitivity, the built-tied dictionary, the forced
  criterion, the located frontier); the crux fields stay `none`. The dictionary is a theorem;
  the construction is complete down to its one honest input (the η-tail / the zeros); the
  positivity does not close from anything built. **RH stays OPEN.**
- **The Voros growth dichotomy, mechanized** (`F1Square/Analysis/Voros.lean`) — a frontier brick.
  Voros (*Math. Phys. Anal. Geom.* 9 (2006)) is the sharpest statement of the RH-hardness of Li
  positivity: `λₙ` has exactly two mutually-exclusive asymptotic forms — tempered `∼ (n/2)log n`
  (RH) vs exponentially oscillating `∼ Σ((τₖ+i/2)/(τₖ−i/2))ⁿ` (¬RH), no third option. The genuine
  CONSTRUCTIVE skeleton is built unconditionally: `tempered_not_exp`/`exp_not_tempered` — a
  polynomially-bounded sequence (`|λₙ| ≤ C(n+1)²`) can NEVER exceed `2ⁿ` infinitely often (the
  regimes are disjoint), via `cube_le_pow2` (`(n+1)³ ≤ 2ⁿ`, `n ≥ 11`) → `quad_lt_pow2`. The
  RH-equivalent *identification* of a regime (the saddle-point content) stays faithful interface.
  Deep-research-confirmed (104 agents) against the primary Voros/Coffey/Lagarias/Yoshida sources,
  which pin the genuine unconditional levers (Coffey's `λₙ ≥ trend − |S2|`, math-ph/0505052;
  Yoshida–Bombieri small-support Weil positivity) — all bottoming out at the same `|S2|`/RH-hard
  step, so no unconditional closure exists.
- **The second Stieltjes constant `γ₂ ≈ −0.00969` as a genuine constructive real**
  (`F1Square/Analysis/GammaTwo.lean`) — `Rgamma2 := Rlim g2SeqDyadic`, the `H¹`-object ingredient
  feeding `λ₃`. The defining sequence `g₂(N) = Σ_{k≤N}(ln k)²/k − ⅓(ln N)³` telescopes to `Σ eₖ`,
  `eₖ = (ln k)²/k − ⅓((ln k)³−(ln(k−1))³)`; the cubic-difference algebra (`cube_diff_identity`,
  `tri_sum_3a2` — discharged by the new UOR **`RAddNF`** signed-atom normalizer, the κ-form solution
  to the absent Real ring/abel tactic) yields the two-sided per-step envelopes
  `−ln(p+1)²/(p(p+1)) ≤ eₖ ≤ ln(p+1)/p²`. These are summed over dyadic blocks (log/log² caps
  `logN(j+2) ≤ a+2`) and telescoped with the discrete antiderivatives `T_U(m)=(4m+12)/2^m` and the
  QUADRATIC `T_L(m)=(2m²+12m+22)/2^m` — the new ingredient over `γ₁`, whose outer sum was linear.
  Reindex `M(j)=2j+8` with domination `(j+1)(2M²+12M+22) ≤ 2^M` (via `8j²+88j+246 ≤ 2^{j+8}`) gives
  pairwise Cauchy `±1/(j+1)` → `RReg_of_real_bound` → `Rlim`. Choice-free (`{propext, Quot.sound}`),
  audited. Mirrors the `GammaOne`/`γ₁` regularity endgame column-for-column.
- **THE CERTIFIED BRACKET `γ₂ ≥ −0.02` via DISCRETE Euler–Maclaurin** (`Rgamma2_ge_neg002`,
  `F1Square/Analysis/GammaTwoBracket.lean`) — **complete**. The corrected route needs NO constructive
  integration: the trapezoidal anchor `½f(N)` (`f(x)=ln²x/x`) captures the leading `½ln²N/N` tail,
  leaving `hSeq(N)=g₂(N)−½f(N) → γ₂` whose per-step increment is the trapezoidal residual `s_p =
  ½[ln²(p+1)/(p+1)+ln²p/p] − ⅓[ln³(p+1)−ln³p] = O(ln²p/p³)` (`hSeq`, `sStep`, `hSeq_step_eq`). The
  chain, end to end:
  - **The keystone decomposition** `sStep p ≈ b²·C2 + b·R1 + R0` (`sStep_decomp`) — `C2 = ½(1/p+1/(p+1))
    − d` the trapezoidal error of `1/x`, `R1 = d·u1 − d²`, `R0 = ½d²u1 − ⅓d³` (`b=ln p`, `d=ln(p+1)−ln
    p`). A free polynomial identity in 4 atoms, proved by reducing both sides to the SAME 7 canonical
    monomials with the `RAddNF`+`RMulNF` ring engine (`sq_binom2`, `inner_merge`, `partA_eq`/`partC_eq`,
    the `½·2=1`/`⅓·3=1` collapses) matched by an explicit choice-free 7-element permutation.
  - **`C2 ≥ 0` (trapezoid ≥ integral)** dissolved by a clean coincidence — `dPlusQ(0,p) = M = ½(1/p+1/(p+1))`
    EXACTLY (`dPlusQ_zero_eq_mid`, a `ring_uor` identity: the trapezoidal midpoint *is* the `T=0` artanh
    upper bound), so `δ ≤ M` with no series comparison (`C2_nonneg`).
  - **Per-step lower bound** `s_{j+1} ≥ −1/((j+1)(j+2))` (`sStep_lower_tele`) — all coefficient pieces
    bounded by rationals (`d ≤ 1/p`, `d − u1 ≤ M − u1 = 1/(2p(p+1))`, `ln p ≤ p`), then `cube_dom_nat`
    collapses the two terms to one TELESCOPING term (no dyadic machinery needed for the tail).
  - **Telescoping tail** `hSeq(N+k) ≥ hSeq(N) − (1/(N+1) − 1/(N+k+1))` (`hSeq_tele`, induction) ⟹
    `hSeq(M) ≥ hSeq(199) − 1/200` for all `M` (`hSeq_lower_const`).
  - **The limit** `γ₂ ≥ hSeq(199) − 1/200` (`Rgamma2_ge_hSeq`) — each `g2SeqDyadic k = g2Seq(2^{2k+8}) ≥
    hSeq(2^{2k+8}) ≥ hSeq(199) − 1/200`, so the limit `γ₂ = Rlim g2SeqDyadic` is too (one-sided
    Archimedean via the `RTendsTo` rate); mirrors `γ₁`'s `Rgamma1_le_gSeq`.
  - **The numeric heart** — `hSeq(199) ≥ ofQ(gBound2 3 10⁸ 199)` (`hSeq_ge_gBound2`, from
    `lnSqSumLo_le`/`logCube_le`/`halfSqOver_le`) and `gBound2 3 10⁸ 199 − 1/200 ≥ −1/50`
    (`gamma2_decide`, one big-integer kernel `decide`, ≈3s, depth `T=3`, denominator `D=10⁸`). The
    lower bound is wrapped as a `def` (`gBound2`) so the deep evaluator term stays opaque in the flat
    final proof — the `γ₁`/`gBound` pattern. Choice-free (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), audited.
- **The third Li coefficient `λ₃` in closed form** (`F1Square/Analysis/LambdaThree.lean`) — the next
  rung of the genuine λ-ladder, the first to carry `γ₂` (`Rgamma2`). The genuine `λₙ = λₙ^{arith} +
  λₙ^{∞}` is already general; this adds the next η-anchor (deep-research-confirmed
  Bombieri–Lagarias / Keiper–Li): **`η₂ = −γ³ − 3γγ₁ − (3/2)γ₂`** (`Reta2`, the first anchor needing
  `γ₂`), the `StieltjesEta3` structure extending `StieltjesEta` with it, and `λ₃^{arith} = −(3η₀ +
  3η₁ + η₂)` (`Rlambda3_arith`). The archimedean side `λ₃^{∞} = genuineArchSeq 3` (already general,
  via `ζ(2), ζ(3)`) needs no new work, so `Rlambda3 = λ₃^{arith} + λ₃^{∞}` is a closed-form
  constructive real. For ANY η-data anchored through `η₂` the genuine ladder meets it at `n = 3`
  (`genuineArith_three`, `genuineLam_three`) exactly as at `n = 1, 2` — the closed form is faithful,
  not ad hoc. `Pos λ₃` is NOT claimed: the `γ₂` bracket that gates the `η₂` term is now closed
  (`γ₂ ≥ −0.02`, above), but `λ₃ ≈ 0.2076` (`λ₃^{arith} ≈ +1.22`, `λ₃^{∞} ≈ −1.013`; margin ≈ 0.21) is
  a heavily-cancelled combination of `Θ(1)` terms, so a positivity certificate needs all of
  `γ, γ₁, γ₂, ζ(2), ζ(3), log 4π` to ~0.1–0.3% relative precision (the binding constraint is `γ₁`) —
  the full `λ₃`-formula numeric assembly, the remaining open work. Choice-free, audited. The crux
  fields stay `none`. (Erratum: earlier drafts of this entry stated `λ₃ ≈ 0.0173` / `λ₃^{∞} ≈ −1.20`,
  a computational error; the correct standard Li value is `0.2076`.)
- **The Li-term modulus growth law** (`F1Square/Analysis/LiGrowth.lean`) — ties Lever 1 to the Voros
  dichotomy, and is the first end-to-end use of the `RAddNF`+`RMulNF` "ring" engine. `cnormSq_mul`
  proves the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci multiplicativity `|zw|² = |z|²·|w|²` constructively: expand both
  squared parts into degree-4 monomials, the cross terms `±abcd` cancel (`cancelC`, one pair after
  `regroupX`/`add4_perm1`), the four surviving squares match `(a²+b²)(c²+d²)` (`prod_sq_reassoc` +
  `add4_perm2`). Hence the power law `|zⁿ|² = (|z|²)ⁿ` (`cnormSq_npow`) and **the growth seed**
  (`liTerm_dominates`): a zero LEFT of the critical line (`Re ρ < ½`) makes its Li numerator `(ρ−1)ⁿ`
  dominate `ρⁿ` in modulus for EVERY `n` — `(cnormSq ρ)ⁿ ≤ (csubOneNormSq ρ)ⁿ` — so
  `|(1−1/ρ)ⁿ| ≥ 1` grows geometrically, the constructive heart of the exponential (¬RH) regime. The
  SUM aggregation (Voros's saddle-point) and WHERE the zeros sit stay [CLASSICAL] interface; crux
  fields stay `none`. Choice-free, audited.
- **Lever 1 — the Li/zero growth geometry** (`F1Square/Analysis/ZeroGeometry.lean`): the constructive
  bridge from a zero's POSITION to the GROWTH of its Li contribution, feeding the Voros dichotomy and
  the de la Vallée-Poussin zero-free region. Each Riemann zero `ρ` contributes `1 − (1−1/ρ)ⁿ` to
  `λₙ`, whose growth is governed by the squared ratio `|1−1/ρ|² = |ρ−1|²/|ρ|²`. The genuine
  constructive nugget, proved unconditionally and without `sqrt` (`liRatio_diff_eq`):
  **`|ρ−1|² − |ρ|² = 1 − 2·Re ρ`** — the `Im ρ` terms cancel exactly, so the regime is fixed by which
  side of the critical line the zero lies on: `Re ρ = ½` ⟹ ratio `1` (bounded, Voros's tempered/RH
  seed, `liRatio_on_line`); `Re ρ < ½` ⟹ ratio `> 1` (an exponentially growing Li term, the ¬RH seed,
  `liRatio_left_of_line`); `Re ρ > ½` ⟹ ratio `< 1` (`liRatio_right_of_line`). The dVP band
  (`DVPBand δ`) does NOT collapse to the line — `dvp_band_admits_off_line` exhibits a band-resident
  off-line zero (ratio `> 1` AND band membership coexisting), so `DVPBand δ` for `δ > 0` is strictly
  weaker than `AllZerosOnLine`; that residual gap (band ⟹ line) is RH itself. The additive
  rearrangements run through the genuine abelian-group laws (`Req_of_seq_Qeq` can't see through
  `Rmul`'s nor reshape `Radd`'s Bishop reindexing). WHERE the zeros sit, and that the SUM `λₙ`
  inherits a single term's growth (Voros's saddle-point), stay [CLASSICAL] interface; the crux fields
  stay `none`.
- **The UOR Real additive-group normalizer `RAddNF`** (`F1Square/Analysis/RAddNF.lean`) — the κ-form
  solution to the central mechanization blocker. `ring_uor` is Int/ℚ-only and the pointwise Real
  route clears denominators multiplicatively (any atom occurring 3+ times explodes), so additive
  Real identities had no tactic. `RsumL` canonicalizes a `Radd`/`Rneg`/`Rsub` tree to a list of
  signed-atom summands; equality is decided by the multiset (`RsumL_perm` permutation-invariance +
  `RsumL_cancel_anywhere` choice-free positional cancellation — no `List.Perm` `decide`, which pulls
  `Classical.choice`). The reusable abelian-group analogue of `ring_uor`; it drives the `γ₂` cubic
  telescoping and every `λₙ` assembly.
- **The UOR Real multiplicative normalizer `RMulNF`** (`F1Square/Analysis/RMulNF.lean`) — the κ-form
  companion of `RAddNF`, the second half of a `Real` "ring" engine. Real MULTIPLICATIVE identities had
  no tactic for the same reason additive ones didn't (`ring_uor` is ℤ/ℚ-only; the pointwise route
  can't see through `Rmul`'s Bishop reindexing). `RprodL` canonicalizes a `Rmul`-tree to the product
  of a factor LIST; equality is decided by the multiset (`RprodL_perm`, from the genuine `Rmul`
  commutativity/associativity). Permutation-only — `Real` has no universal multiplicative inverse, so
  there is no cancellation layer (all degree-`d` monomial normalization needs is permutation).
  `Rmul_pair_eq_RprodL4` is the degree-4 flatten; `prod_sq_reassoc` (`(ac)² ≈ a²c²`) and
  `prod_cross_reassoc` (`(ac)(bd) ≈ (ad)(bc)`) are the validated monomial atoms (the square and the
  cross-term of `|zw|² = |z|²|w|²`), with the permutations built EXPLICITLY via `List.Perm`
  constructors (`decide` on `List.Perm` pulls `Classical.choice`). With `RAddNF` this stands in for a
  `Real` `ring` tactic: expand to monomials, normalize each with `RprodL_perm`, match the sum with
  `RsumL_perm`. Choice-free, audited.
- **Honesty-gate rigor fix** (`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`) — load-bearing. Checks 3 (no
  `sorry`/`native_decide`) and 4 (choice-free) used `… | grep -q …` inside an `if`-condition
  under `set -o pipefail`: a matching `grep -q` exits early, SIGPIPEs the upstream `grep`, and
  pipefail makes the pipeline's status that non-zero code — which `if` reads as FALSE, so the
  FAIL branch never ran. **The forbidden-axiom and choice-free gates were effectively disabled.**
  Fixed (capture-then-test, no `grep -q`); verified the gate now FIRES on violations and PASSES
  clean. The fix exposed and removed a pre-existing `Classical.choice` leak (`graph_one_diag`,
  `omega` on an `↔`; reproved `Nat.one_mul`+`eq_comm`) — so the choice-free claim
  (`{propext, Quot.sound}` only) is now genuinely *enforced*, not merely asserted.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added — stage E: completion — the explicit formula, the dominance face, the roll-up (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`, choice-free)

The three stage-E release goals are delivered: **the explicit-formula trace is completed** (the zero
side realized at the Bombieri–Lagarias slices), **the remaining `Li` interfaces are retired** at the
built slices, and **the final F1-square roll-up** records the v1.0.0-candidate state — plus **THE
DOMINANCE FACE**: the crux as a single uniform bound, proven equivalent to both prior faces. The
crux did not close — now a *sourced* result, not a presumption — so `hodgeIndexHolds`/
`liPositivityHolds` stay `none` and **RH stays OPEN**. Every theorem is choice-free
(`{propext, Quot.sound}`), audited; the build is warning-free; the gate passes.

- **The completed explicit-formula trace** (`F1Square/Analysis/LiComplete.lean`) —
  `Li.ExplicitFormulaTrace`, until now inhabited only by the trivial split `z = z + 0`, is REALIZED
  with the genuine three-sided reading at both built slices (`explicitFormulaTrace_one_realized`,
  `explicitFormulaTrace_two_realized`): zero side `λ₁`/`λ₂` (the sum-over-zeros reading is
  [CLASSICAL], BL 1999 — the zeros are not constructed and nothing pretends they are), finite-place
  closed forms `γ` and `2γ − (γ² + 2γ₁)`, archimedean parts — all three reals built. Packaged as the
  **`WeilTrace` ladder** (`weilTraceTwo`, the trace identity at every positive index;
  `weilTraceTwo_evidence`). Convention notes pinned (deep-research-verified): the Lagarias⟷BL
  grouping (`λₙ = S∞(n) − S_f(n) + 1` vs `λₙ^{arith} = −S_f`, `λₙ^{∞} = S∞ + 1`, confirmed against
  both built slices to 30 digits); the arithmetic closed form sourced from the η-polynomial form
  (the arXiv print of Lagarias eq. (4.13) carries a sign typo — not used); unconditionally the
  finite-place part equals the zero sum truncated at height `√n` up to `O(√n·log n)` (Lagarias
  Thm 6.1) — the precise sense in which the prime side IS an incomplete zero side.
- **`Li.LiAgreesWith` retired at the built slices** (`liAgreesWith_two_realized`) — computed (the
  direct certified builds `Rlambda1` via the accelerated-γ assembly, `Rlambda2` via the
  Stieltjes/ζ(2) assembly) agrees with classical (the BL closed-form assemblies,
  `liClassicalSeqTwo`) — genuinely non-reflexive at `n = 1, 2`, the agreement being the content of
  `Rlambda1_decomposition`/`Rlambda2_decomposition`. A REALIZATION LEDGER in `Li.lean` records the
  boundary: every `Li` interface is realized exactly as far as the built slices reach, no further.
- **THE DOMINANCE FACE** (`F1Square/Square/Dominance.lean`) — the crux as ONE uniform bound:
  `Dominates B arith arch` (`−B(n) ≤ arith(n)` — the bound controls the oscillation's negative
  excursions — and `arch(n) − B(n) > 0` — it stays strictly below the archimedean trend),
  `Dominated` its single existential. Sign-agnostic in both parts: no case split between the
  small-`n` regime (archimedean part NEGATIVE: `λ₁^{∞} ≈ −0.5541`, `λ₂^{∞} ≈ −0.8745`, re-verified
  to 30 digits) and the asymptotic regime (roles swapped); the dichotomy is clean, no third option.
  **The theorems**: `dominated_liPositive` / `liPositive_dominated` / `dominated_iff_liPositive`
  (under the trace, "some single bound dominates" ⟺ `λₙ > 0 ∀n` — genuinely universal WITHOUT
  enumeration; the necessity witness is the tight bound `B(n) = arch(n) − λₙ`), and
  **`dominance_crux_equivalent`**: `Dominated ⟺ SpectralCrux ⟺ LiCrux` through the v0.18.0 bridge —
  **the crux now has THREE provably equivalent faces** (geometric `⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ < 0 ∀n`, analytic
  `λₙ > 0 ∀n`, dominance `∃ one bound under which oscillation loses`); `weilTrace_dominance` reads
  the completed trace ladder through it. **The assembly shape, exact**: `dominance_head_tail` +
  `crux_closure_route` — the certified head (today `n ≤ 2`) plus ONE tail bound from `n = 3` on
  yields the crux; the tail bound for the genuine parts is the single remaining object, provably
  equivalent to the v0.18.0 frontier. **Honesty guards, two-sided**: `dominance_satisfiable` (no
  hidden impossibility; the loose existential is NOT RH), `twoSlice_not_dominated` +
  `weilTraceTwo_not_crux` (the finite-assembly guard transfers to this face).
- **The classical sourcing, deep-research-verified** (101 agents, 23 claims confirmed 3-0 against
  the primary PDFs, 2 refuted): **Voros's strict dichotomy** (*Math. Phys. Anal. Geom.* 9 (2006)
  53–63, arXiv math/0506326 — "two sharply distinct and mutually exclusive asymptotic forms", NO
  third option): RH ⟺ `λₙ ~ ½n(log n − 1 + γ − log 2π)` mod `o(n)`; ¬RH ⟺ exponential oscillation
  `Σ((τₖ+i/2)/(τₖ−i/2))ⁿ + c.c.`, rate `|1 − 1/ρ| > 1` for the `Re ρ < 1/2` member of each
  off-line pair (rigorous via Darboux in the 2006 paper; the 2004 note's sign erratum pinned as a
  convention trap). **Lagarias** (*Ann. Inst. Fourier* 57 (2007) 1689–1740): the archimedean trend
  `(n/2)log n + cn + O(1)`, `c = (γ − 1 − log 2π)/2`, **unconditional** (Thm 5.1; Voros pins the ζ
  `O(1)` to `+3/4`); the `O(√n·log n)` excursion bound on the arithmetic part — a THEOREM under RH
  (Thm 6.1). The general-`n` archimedean closed form
  `λₙ^{∞} = 1 − (n/2)(γ + log 4π) + Σ_{j=2}^n (−1)ʲ C(n,j)(1 − 2^{−j})ζ(j)` matches the built
  slices exactly. Net: `Dominated`(genuine parts) is TRUE iff RH — both directions confirmed at the
  asymptotic level — and **no unconditional tail bound exists in the verified literature** (the
  one-sided shape is published only as Coffey's sufficiency Conjectures 2–3, math-ph/0505052); the
  equivalence-by-regrouping is this release's theorem, per the Conrey–Li relocation discipline.
- **THE GENUINE ARCHIMEDEAN TREND, ALL `n`** (`F1Square/Analysis/ArchTrend.lean`) — the closure
  push: the archimedean side of the crux as a single constructed object, `genuineArchSeq n =
  1 − (n/2)(γ + log 4π) + Σ_{j=2}^n (−1)ʲC(n,j)(1 − 2^{−j})ζ(j)` for EVERY `n` — one definition, no
  enumeration; every ingredient already built (`γ`, `log 4π`, `ζ(j)` for all `j ≥ 2`, binomials).
  Consistency THEOREMS at both independently-built slices (`genuineArch_one`/`genuineArch_two` —
  genuine reconciliations of distinct constructions). **`crux_vs_constructed_trend`** — the sharpest
  honest statement of RH this substrate provides: for any spectral square whose trace splits against
  the BUILT trend, the crux ⟺ "the arithmetic part admits one bound strictly below
  `genuineArchSeq`". The open content of RH contracts to the arithmetic side alone; the trend's
  classical growth is sourced, not mechanized; nothing touches positivity of the genuine `λₙ`.
- **THE GENUINE LI SEQUENCE IN CLOSED FORM** (`F1Square/Analysis/GenuineLi.lean`) — the
  implementation's deepest open question ("the genuine sequences are unconstructed") closed modulo
  the Stieltjes tail: `StieltjesEta` (η-data with the BUILT anchors `η₀ = −γ`, `η₁ = γ² + 2γ₁` as
  proof fields), `genuineArithSeq` (`λₙ^{arith} = −Σ_{j=1}^n C(n,j)·η_{j−1}`, every `n` — the
  verified non-alternating closed form, anchored to BOTH mechanized slices as theorems
  `genuineArith_one/two`; the Coffey recursion deliberately NOT used, convention guard), and
  **`genuineLamSeq` — the genuine Li sequence with both sides closed forms** (`weilTraceGenuine`:
  the full-ladder trace, definitional at every positive index, exactly as classically `λₙ` is
  defined through the explicit formula). The closed form MEETS the certified values
  (`genuineLam_one/two`), so **the head is a THEOREM** (`genuineLam_head`: `Pos` at `n = 1, 2` for
  ANY anchored η-data). `etaTwoSlice` inhabits the structure; its `n ≥ 3` outputs are flagged
  TRUNCATIONS (caution (d)). **`crux_genuine_form`** + **`crux_genuine_route`** (the maximal honest
  reduction): the crux follows from exactly TWO open inputs — the genuine η-tail (`γ₂, γ₃, …`,
  constructible one at a time by the `GammaOne` pattern) and ONE bound between the two closed forms
  from `n = 3` on, a bound that exists iff RH. The head is DISCHARGED; neither input is asserted.
- **The final roll-up** (`F1Square.lean`) — the stage-E backing block, the elaboration-checked
  v0.19.0 witness (both trace realizations, the retirement, the ∀-form three-face equivalence, the
  dominance reading, both guards, crux fields `none`), and the **v1.0.0-candidate state**: complete
  construction, honest crux. Workspace hygiene: warning-free build; `Li.lean` realization ledger;
  `Attempt.lean` frontier cross-pointer.

- **THE GENUINE-PAIRING ARC** (the closure push, continued — the formerly-planned v0.20/v0.21
  work folded into this release; deep-research #4: 99 agents, 21 claims confirmed 3-0 against the
  primary PDFs, 4 refuted):
  - *Substrate*: `Analysis/RMax.lean` — `Rabs` (Bishop-regular with no reindex, via the reverse
    triangle inequality on exact ℚ), `RmaxZero = ½(t+|t|)`, and the tent calculus (non-negativity,
    vanishing off support, identity on support) — compactly-supported piecewise-linear test
    functions as total `Real → Real` functions; `Analysis/RSum.lean` — finite real sums with the
    congruence/PSD/monotonicity transports.
  - **THE WEIL FUNCTIONAL, assembled** (`Analysis/Weil.lean`, `Square/Pairing.lean`): in the pinned
    CC unsymmetrized normalization (arXiv 2006.13771 App. B; the three-normalization trap and the
    `dx` vs `dx/x` involution trap recorded), `W(f) = poles − (primes + archimedean)` — **the zero
    side is the DEFECT of the built sides; no zeros are inputs**. CONSTRUCTED: the whole
    finite-place side `weilPrimePart = Σ_{n≤X} Λ(n)(f(n) + n⁻¹f(1/n))` (rational weights, finite by
    support, stable past the cutoff) and the archimedean constant `(log 4π + γ)·f(1)` (both factors
    built). INTERFACE (the faithful boundary): the pole terms and the archimedean integral — their
    piecewise-linear closed forms are routine but **unverified in print** (the deep-research open
    question), so transcribing them would breach the gate. Piecewise-linear test data is ADMISSIBLE
    to Weil's criterion directly (Bombieri's class `W`, the official Clay problem description §V).
  - **THE FOURTH FACE** : `weilSpectralSquare` — the FIRST `SpectralSquare` whose `cSq` comes from a
    pairing-valued assembly (the dictionary holds by construction) — with `weil_psd_iff_hodge` and
    `weil_strict_iff_crux`: positivity of the pairing family ⟺ the crux ⟺ Li positivity ⟺
    dominance. For the genuine family this is Weil positivity = RH — **elementary in both
    directions** (Weil 1952; Burnol math/9810169 proves the Lemma directly, no density argument —
    the presumed 'hard direction' was adversarially refuted). Guard: `weil_template_crux`.
  - **The first computed pairing value** (`weilPrime_demo`): the finite-place side at the
    piecewise-linear tent peaked at `2` is exactly `log 2` — the pairing sees the prime through the
    test function (the §2.3 "separation = Λ" finding, now on the pairing side, as a theorem).
  - **The unconditional territory, recorded** (pinned, not asserted): Connes–Consani (Selecta
    Math. 27 (2021), Thm 1) — Weil positivity is UNCONDITIONAL for test support in
    `[2^{−1/2}, 2^{1/2}]` (the prime-free window — where the constructed finite-place side vanishes
    by `weilPrimePart_stable`'s discipline); the certificate is the Sonine-space projection
    (infinite-dimensional). Burnol's precursor window carries an EXPLICIT nonnegative spectral
    multiplier `α(τ) = 8√2·cos(τ log 2)/(1+4τ²) + h₊(τ)`, `h₊ = −log π + Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2)` — the
    natural constructive SOS target (needs uniform-in-τ digamma bounds; the pinned next
    mechanization). **The window theorem holds on the built object** (`weilPrime_window`/
    `weilValue_window`): a test datum with support inside the prime-free window has identically
    vanishing finite-place side at every truncation depth, so the assembled `W` reduces in-window
    to `poles − archimedean` — the exact statement the certificate program starts from, as a
    theorem of the assembly. Bombieri's Lincei truncations were verified to be ZERO-INDEXED (not
    zero-free certification targets) — that route is honestly closed.
  - **THE WINDOW CERTIFICATE, computed** (`Analysis/PsiQuarter.lean`, `Analysis/BurnolAlpha.lean`):
    Burnol's spectral multiplier `α(τ) = 8√2·cos(τ log2)/(1+4τ²) + h₊(τ)`,
    `h₊(τ) = −logπ + Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2)`, evaluated at the center of the prime-free window. **ψ(1/4)**
    is built as the FIRST exact non-trivial digamma value — at `z = 1/4` the digamma series has
    exact-rational terms `1/(n+1) − 1/(n+1/4) = −3/[(n+1)(4n+1)]`, a sign-definite series with a
    telescoping tail, giving a genuine direct-sequence constructive real with `ψ(1/4) ≥ −4.32`
    (true `≈ −4.2270`, via `Rgamma_h_upper` and a uniform partial-sum bound). **`α(0) > 0`**
    (`burnolAlphaZero_pos`, true `≈ 5.94`) is then an axiom-clean theorem — `8√2 − logπ + ψ(1/4)`,
    with `√2 = exp(½ log2) ≥ 1` (`RrpowPos`, no sqrt primitive) — certified from the wide margin
    `8·1 − 1.15 − 4.32 = 2.53 > 0`. This is EVIDENCE for the windowed Weil positivity (the
    multiplier at one point), exactly as `weilPrime_demo` / the certified `λ`-slices are evidence —
    NOT the universal `α(τ) ≥ 0 ∀τ` (needs the uniform-in-τ complex-digamma bound), still less RH
    (the window excludes every prime). The universal window theorem stays the pinned next target.
  - **THE τ-PARAMETERIZED KERNEL + THE HONEST INDEFINITENESS FINDING** (`Analysis/DigammaWindow.lean`):
    the kernel `Re ψ(1/4 + iτ/2)` has exact-rational terms (even in `τ`); `windowKernel`
    `g_n(s) = (n+1/4)/((n+1/4)²+s)` is proven ANTITONE in `s = τ²/4` (`windowKernel_antitone`), so
    `windowTerm = 1/(n+1) − g_n` is MONOTONE INCREASING in `τ²` (`windowTerm_mono`) — hence `h₊(τ)`
    increases from `h₊(0) ≈ −5.37` toward `+∞`; `windowTerm_zero` reduces the kernel at `τ = 0` to
    `ψ(1/4)`'s summand. **The load-bearing finding** (recorded faithfully): the BARE multiplier `α`
    is **NOT** pointwise non-negative — `α(0) ≈ 5.94 > 0` but `α` is INDEFINITE, dipping to `≈ −1.0`
    near `τ ≈ 2.27`. This is exactly why Burnol needs the restricted-class `A_ε`-correction and
    Connes–Consani need the Sonine projection: **`α(τ) ≥ 0 ∀τ` is NOT a theorem**, so the
    unconditional window positivity stays the honest interface — the monotone kernel (which bounds
    the negative band) is the correct object the genuine window theorem is built from (v0.20.0).

### Honest scope (the bright line, unchanged)
- The dominance face RELOCATES the difficulty (Conrey–Li); it does not remove it. The open content
  of RH is now ONE object: a single bound sequence dominating the genuine arithmetic part strictly
  below the genuine archimedean trend — which exists iff RH (verified both directions). Nothing
  asserts it; `hodgeIndexHolds`/`liPositivityHolds` stay `none`; **RH stays OPEN**. The certified
  slices remain `n = 1, 2`; the next slice needs `γ₂`.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added — stage D: the bridge and the crux attempt (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`, choice-free)

The two stage-D release goals are delivered: **the geometric and analytic faces of the crux are proven
equivalent**, and **the crux attempt ran under the gate** — it did not close the universal, so
`hodgeIndexHolds`/`liPositivityHolds` stay `none` and **RH stays OPEN**, with the bridge substrate shipped
exactly as scoped. Every theorem is choice-free (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), audited; the gate passes.

- **The Castelnuovo–Severi anchor** (`F1Square/BridgeFF.lean`) — the function-field model of
  "Hodge index ⟹ RH" as a genuine lattice derivation, no governor shortcut: the `E × E` lattice
  `{F_h, F_v, Δ, Γ}` with the standard Gram (`Γ` bidegree `(1, q)`; `Δ² = Γ² = 0`, genus-1 adjunction;
  the **trace datum** `Δ·Γ = q+1−a` by Lefschetz — `ff_trace_datum`); the primitive projection
  `D° = D − (D·F_v)F_h − (D·F_h)F_v` of `D = xΔ + yΓ` (`primDG_perp_h/v`); the computation
  **`primDG_sq`**: `D°² = −2(x² + a·xy + q·y²)` — the Hodge-index form IS the binary quadratic form of
  discriminant `a² − 4q`; and **`ff_hodge_iff_hasse`**: `∀x,y D°² ≤ 0 ⟺ a² ≤ 4q` (forward: instantiate
  `(a, −2)`; backward: `4(x²+axy+qy²) = (2x+ay)² + (4q−a²)y²`). `ff_hodge_iff_hodgeType` derives the
  v0.1.0 governor from lattice positivity — "§0.3: the mechanism is not the gap" is now a theorem.
- **The λ₂ Bombieri–Lagarias decomposition** (`F1Square/Analysis/LiTwo.lean`) —
  `λ₂^{arith} = −(2η₀ + η₁) = 2γ − (γ² + 2γ₁)` (the prime side, via the Stieltjes `γ₁`) and
  `λ₂^{∞} = (1−γ) − log 4π + ¾ζ(2)` (the Γ-factor place); **`Rlambda2_decomposition`** proves
  `λ₂ = λ₂^{arith} + λ₂^{∞}` as a constructive-real identity. **`li_decomposition_two_realized`**:
  `Li.LiDecomposition` realized with BOTH genuine slices (`n = 1` from v0.15.3, `n = 2` new), both
  certified positive (`liTwo_evidence`).
- **THE BRIDGE** (`F1Square/Square/Spectral.lean`) — the release goal. `SpectralSquare`: the `H¹`-bearing
  enrichment of `𝕊` as an interface — the Li/trace data `lam`, the primitive-class self-intersections
  `cSq`, and the **dictionary** `⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ = −2λₙ` (Deninger's Hodge-index reading of Li's criterion,
  Proc. Symp. Pure Math. 55 (1994); normalized exactly as `BridgeFF.primDG_sq` derives it on the
  function-field model; the classical chain "RH ⟺ Weil positivity ⟺ λₙ ≥ 0" is Weil 1952 / Li 1997 /
  Bombieri–Lagarias 1999 / Bombieri 2000). The equivalence is a genuine constructive **theorem**:
  `spectral_bridge_nonneg` (`⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ ≤ 0 ∀n ⟺ Li.LiNonneg`), `spectral_bridge_pos(_slice)` (strict ⟺
  `Li.LiPositive`), and **`crux_faces_equivalent : SpectralCrux S ⟺ Li.LiCrux S.lam`** — via new
  doubling lemmas (`Pos_of_Radd_self` at the sequence level: a witness `1/(n+1) < 2x_{2n+1}` halves to
  `1/(2n+2) < x_{2n+1}`). Inhabited by `spectralTwoSlice` (the genuine certified `λ₁, λ₂`;
  `spectral_evidence_two`: `⟨C₁,C₁⟩ < 0` and `⟨C₂,C₂⟩ < 0` — the geometric face's first genuine
  negativity slices). **Honesty guards as theorems**: `spectralTwoSlice_not_crux` (the finite-slice
  instance provably FAILS the crux — its `n = 3` slice vanishes) and `spectral_iff_all_upTo` (no finite
  run of negativity checks reaches the crux — the finite-check guard, geometric face).
- **The crux attempt, under the gate** (`F1Square/Square/Attempt.lean`) — run, recorded, honestly
  concluded. Certified: strict Hodge negativity through `n = 2` (`spectral_strict_upTo_two`), the
  furthest any axiom-clean run reaches in this substrate. The frontier, exact:
  **`crux_attempt_frontier(_geometric)`** — given the certified slices, the crux ⟺ `∀ n ≥ 3, λₙ > 0`
  (the next slice needs `γ₂`, a fresh `GammaOne`-scale mechanization). The post-mortem records why the
  general routes are blocked, with the program's own controls as evidence (vacuous-kernel control
  `Bridge.control_psd`; pencil-blindness `square_hodge_pencil_blind`; the BL cancellation, companion
  §8.1; the Conrey–Li precedent) and what would close it (the genuine `H¹` instance, T4/§3.4 —
  Connes–Consani's archimedean/semilocal Weil positivity, Selecta Math. 27 (2021), being the strongest
  partial result). **Conclusion: the universal did not close; the fields stay `none`.**

### Honest scope (the bright line, unchanged)
- The bridge makes the two crux faces ONE proposition; it does not make that proposition easier. The
  certified slices are `n = 1, 2`; `λₙ > 0 ∀n` (= RH, both faces) stays open;
  `hodgeIndexHolds`/`liPositivityHolds` stay `none`. The genuine spectral instance (`H¹` with spectrum =
  the zeros) remains the program's single open object (T4/§3.4), now with the exact shape of what
  carrying it buys (`BridgeFF`).

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added — stage C: the canonical arithmetic square `𝕊 = Spec ℤ ×_𝔽₁ Spec ℤ` with its derived intersection lattice (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`, choice-free)

The stage-C release goals are delivered (`F1Square/Square/`, six bricks). Every theorem is choice-free
(`#print axioms` = `{propext, Quot.sound}`), audited in `scripts/audit_axioms.lean`; the build is green and the
honesty gate passes. The crux fields stay `none` — **RH stays open**.

- **Canonical `𝕊` = the tensor `F ⊗_𝔽₁ F`, with its universal property PROVED**
  (`Square/Monoid.lean`, `Square/Tensor.lean`). Deitmar 𝔽₁-algebras are commutative monoids (realized as a
  bundled `CMon` record — the pure-core substitute for the typeclass hierarchy); the curve is the
  multiplicative monoid `ℕ₊` (free commutative on the primes — the canonical form of an element is its prime
  factorization, the UOR content-address); `𝔽₁` is the trivial monoid, proved **initial** (`f1_initial`), so
  the fiber coproduct over it is the plain coproduct: `𝕊 = ℕ₊ × ℕ₊` with injections `a ↦ a⊗1`, `b ↦ 1⊗b` and
  the **universal property** `copair_inl`/`copair_inr`/`copair_unique` (uniqueness via the tensor
  decomposition `z = z₁⊗z₂`, `sq_factor`); the 𝔽₁-cocone condition is automatic (`square_base_cocone`), so
  coproduct = pushout over `𝔽₁`. **Canonicality = the universal property** — `𝕊` is THE object, unique up to
  unique isomorphism, not a candidate model. Non-collapse of §3.1 (`ℤ ⊗_ℤ ℤ = ℤ`) by theorems: `inl ≠ inr`,
  the codiagonal identifies distinct points (`codiag_not_injective`, `gen2_codiag_collapse`), and the
  monomial family `2^a ⊗ 2^b` is **free of rank 2** (`gen2_injective`) — strict 2-dimensionality (T1 for all
  points, not a finite truncation); both projections recover the curve (`proj1_inl`, `proj_faithful`). The
  power Frobenius `frobPow k : a ↦ aᵏ` (a genuine hom) is distinguished from the Connes–Consani scaling flow
  `mScale n : a ↦ n·a` (NOT a hom, `mScale_not_hom` — a correspondence; its graphs are the pencil).
- **The distinguished divisors and their point counts** (`Square/Divisors.lean`): rulings `V_a = {a}×C`,
  `H_b = C×{b}`, diagonal `Δ`, Frobenius correspondences `Γ_n = {(m, n·m)}` as genuine subsets of `𝕊`;
  transverse singletons (`vFiber_inter_hFiber`, `diag_inter_vFiber/_hFiber`, `graph_inter_vFiber/_hFiber`),
  moving disjointness (`vFiber_disjoint`, `hFiber_disjoint`, `graph_disjoint`), the translate structure
  (`graph_translate_diag` — `Γ_n` is the flow translate of `Δ`; `vFiber_translate`), and the §2.3 finding at
  the point level: **`Δ ∩ Γ_n = ∅` for `n ≥ 2`** (`diag_inter_graph_empty`) — the scaling Frobenius has no
  transverse fixed points on canonical `𝕊`.
- **The parallel pencil with its shift lengths `log n`** (`Square/Pencil.lean`) — the §2.3 structural finding
  lifted from the candidate bi-tropical model to theorems on `𝕊`: **`logN_mul_general`**
  (`log(ab) = log a + log b` for ALL positive naturals, by exp injectivity — generalizing the v0.15.2 base-2
  keystone) and `logN_pow_general` (`log pᵏ = k·log p`); **`pencil_shift`** (`log y = log x + log n` on `Γ_n`
  — the affine shift, exact), **`pencil_parallel`** (slope 1 ⇒ recession direction `(1,1)`, the diagonal's
  own), **`pencil_det_zero`** (stable count `Δ·Γ_n = |det((1,1),(1,1))| = 0`, tied to the mechanized
  `Tropical.Signature.parallel_pencil`), **`pencil_separation`** (constant separation `log n`),
  **`pencil_separation_vonMangoldt`** (at a prime the separation IS `Λ(p) = log p`, the explicit-formula
  prime weight of `Analysis/Mangoldt.lean`), and `pencil_separation_pow` (`k·log p` — the closed orbit of
  length `log p` traversed `k` times). **The arithmetic content provably relocates to the shift lengths.**
- **The intersection lattice, DERIVED — never entered by hand** (`Square/Lattice.lean`, the §2.2 declarative
  discipline mechanized): every primitive number is a point count with classes moved along their translation
  pencils (`pair_*_derived`: `V·H = 1`, `V² = H² = 0`, `Δ·V = Δ·H = 1`, **`Δ² = 0` from the parallel-pencil
  disjointness itself**, `Γ·V = Γ·H = 1` — degree-1 translation correspondences, `Γ·Γ = Δ·Γ = 0`);
  bilinearity (`sqPair_add_left`, `sqPair_smul_left`) **forces `E₃² = −2`** (`e3_sq_forced`); the sourced
  §2.2 product-of-curves template **emerges** (`sqPair_eq_template`) — **T3's "realize the pairing
  intrinsically" is closed by derivation**, agreement with the template is now a consistency theorem. The
  five §2.2 gate self-checks are theorems (`sqPair_symm`, `sq_boundary_checks`, `sq_adjunction_checks`,
  `sq_signature_diag` — signature `(1,2)` by explicit diagonalization `{V+H, V−H, E₃} → diag(2,−2,−2)` with
  complementarity). The class lattice is **finitely generated** on the derived basis (`cls_generated`,
  T2 on `𝕊`); the graph class is **forced** (`graph_class_unique`), so `[Γ_n] = [Δ]` for all `n`
  (`pencil_numerically_trivial`).
- **Polarized `𝕊`, the Hodge index of the derived lattice, and the faithfulness boundary**
  (`Square/Polarized.lean`): `squarePolarized` — the `Crux.Polarized` instance is now `𝕊`'s own derived
  lattice (the stage-C lift); the ample class `H = [V]+[H]` has `H² = 2 > 0` (`sq_ample_pos` — verified, NOT
  automatic for a tropical surface) with Nakai-style meets (`sq_ample_meets`); `H^⊥` is negative-definite
  (`sq_hperp_neg_semidef`, `sq_hperp_definite`); **`square_hodgeIndex : HodgeIndex squarePolarized`** holds.
  **And the boundary** (`square_hodge_pencil_blind`): the lattice is **pencil-blind** — `[Γ_n] = [Δ]` and
  `Δ·Γ_n = 0` for ALL `n`, so the function-field trace input (`Δ·Γ_q = q+1−a`, `Mechanism.hodgeType`) is
  provably absent and the positivity carries **no spectral content** — the geometric face of the §2.3
  control (`Bridge.control_psd`). It is therefore **NOT the crux**.
- **Manifest de-hedge** (`F1Square.lean`, `Crux.lean`): `surfaceConstructed` and `parallelPencilFinding`
  flip `none → some true` (honest scope documented: canonical at the monoid-scheme / T1–T3 level; the
  `H¹`-bearing spectral enrichment is NOT constructed); `classGroupFinitelyGen` /
  `intersectionTemplateValid` / `ampleClassExists` are now carried by canonical `𝕊`; the
  `parallelPencilStructure` identity flips to universally valid; two new elaboration-checked witness
  examples bind the layer to the manifest; the `Crux` faithfulness caution is sharpened with the proven
  pencil-blindness boundary.

### Honest scope (the bright line, unchanged)
- The crux is the Hodge index / Weil positivity of the **`H¹`-bearing** pairing — the form on which the
  scaling flow acts with spectrum = the zeta zeros (T4/T5), equivalently `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` (Li). `𝕊`'s coarse
  numerical lattice provably does not carry it (`square_hodge_pencil_blind`), so `square_hodgeIndex` is a
  result about the constructed object and **not** an RH claim. `hodgeIndexHolds` / `liPositivityHolds` stay
  `none` — **RH stays open**. Stating the geometric⟺analytic equivalence faithfully is stage D (v0.18.0).

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added — stage B: critical-strip `ζ`, the archimedean `Γ′/Γ` place, and `Pos λ₂` (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`, choice-free)

The three v0.16.0 release goals are delivered. Every theorem below is choice-free
(`#print axioms` = `{propext, Quot.sound}`), audited in `scripts/audit_axioms.lean`; the build is green
and the honesty gate passes. The crux `liPositivityHolds`/`hodgeIndexHolds` stay `none` — **RH stays open**.

- **(B) `ζ(s)` on the critical strip `0 < Re s < 1`** — built the integration-free way, via the **Dirichlet
  eta** `η(s) = Σ (−1)^{n−1} n⁻ˢ`, which converges by **bounded variation** across the whole strip where the
  raw `ζ` series diverges.
  - `F1Square/Analysis/EtaVariation.lean` — **`Ceta`**: `η(s)` for every `Re s > 0` as a genuine constructive
    `ℂ`, the Bishop diagonal limit (`Rlim`) of the reindexed paired partial sums. The convergence is the full
    dyadic-geometric `RReg` stack adapted to `σ > 0`: the per-term variation bound (a new alternating-series
    quadratic remainder `altSum_quad`, the `RlogNat ↔ logN` bridge, a two-sided product keystone), the pairing
    identity, the geometric block bound `≤ ofQ(Vconst·rᵏ)` (`r = 1/(1+τ) < 1`), the telescoping tail
    `EtaVSum_tail_full → ofQ(Vconst/(j+1))`, the odd-offset subsum, and the reindex `etaMidx` (absorbing the
    `Vconst` prefactor) → `RReg_of_real_bound` → `Rlim`.
  - `F1Square/Analysis/CriticalZeta.lean` — **`CzetaStrip`**: `ζ(s) = η(s) / (1 − 2^{1−s})` for `0 < Re s < 1`,
    a genuine constructive `ℂ`. `cpowNeg_normSq` (`|n⁻ˢ|² = n⁻²ᴿᵉˢ`), the denominator
    `1 − 2^{1−s} = 1 − 2·cpowNeg s 2` (reusing `cpowNeg`, no new `Cexp`), its **non-vanishing**
    `etaDenom_Pos_normSq` (`|1 − 2^{1−s}|² ≥ (2^{1−σ} − 1)² > 0`, the spurious zeros all sit on `Re s = 1`),
    the constructive inverse `Cinv`, and the certificate `CzetaStrip_functional : (1 − 2^{1−s})·ζ ≈ η`. Since
    `ExactBoundedReal = Real`, the real and imaginary parts are exact-bounded objects automatically.
- **(A) The Gamma function via Spouge; the archimedean `Γ′/Γ` place** (`F1Square/Analysis/Gamma.lean`).
  - **`RrpowPos`** — the real power `x^y := exp(y·log x)` for a positive base, the single combinator behind
    every Spouge power (`√(2π) = exp(½·log 2π)`, `(z+a)^{z+½}`, the half-integer `(a−k)^{k−½}`). **No sqrt
    primitive and no complex `Clog` are needed.**
  - **`Digamma`** — the archimedean place `ψ = Γ′/Γ` as a genuine constructive real (the **exact** object, not an
    approximation), via the convergent series `ψ(z) = −γ + Σ_{n≥0}[1/(n+1) − 1/(n+z)]`. Architecture mirrors
    `Ceta`: per-term two-sided bound `|t_n| ≤ B/((n+1)n)` (`Rinv_le_ofQ_Qinv` + a two-sided product bound),
    the telescoping tail `digammaTail_two_sided`, the reindex `digammaMidx` absorbing `B = |z−1|`, then
    `RReg_of_real_bound` → `Rlim`; reuses the Euler–Mascheroni constant `Rgamma_h`.
  - **`SpougeGamma`** — Spouge's approximant of `Γ(z+1) = (z+a)^{z+½}·e^{−(z+a)}·(c₀ + Σ_{k=1}^{N} c_k/(z+k))`,
    `c₀ = √(2π)`, `c_k = ((−1)^{k−1}/(k−1)!)(a−k)^{k−½}e^{a−k}`, as a constructive real built entirely from
    `exp`/`log`/reciprocal of positive reals (general rational parameter `a`). Spouge's explicit **relative**-error
    bound `|ε_S(a,z)| < √a·(2π)^{−(a+½)}/Re(z+a)` (`a ≥ 3`; Spouge 1994 SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 31(3); Pugh thesis
    eqns 2.18–2.19) is **documented, not asserted as a Lean theorem** — a rigorous proof presupposes an
    independent `Γ`, so the *exact* archimedean place is carried by the `Digamma` series instead.
- **(C) `Pos λ₂`** (`F1Square/Analysis/LambdaTwo.lean`) — the second Li/Keiper coefficient is positive
  (`Rlambda2_pos : Pos Rlambda2`, certified lower bound `λ₂ ≥ 0.0043`; true value `λ₂ ≈ 0.0923457`),
  the higher-Stieltjes-`γₙ` → `λₙ` capstone, a
  `λ₁`-style positivity certificate for `n = 2`.

### Honest scope (unchanged)
- `Pos λ₂` is **evidence** for Li's criterion at `n = 2`, **not** the crux: `liPositivityHolds` stays `none`
  and **RH stays open**. `λₙ > 0 ∀ n` (= RH), the off-critical-line zeros, and the arithmetic square remain
  deferred. The Spouge `Γ`-value's error bound is cited, not formalized; the archimedean place used downstream
  is the exact `Digamma`.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-06-10

### Added — the explicit formula's arithmetic ingredient: von Mangoldt `Λ`, the prime side, and the Bombieri–Lagarias `n = 1` decomposition (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- **The von Mangoldt function `Λ`** (`F1Square/Analysis/Mangoldt.lean`) — `vonMangoldt n`: `log p` when
  `n = pᵏ` is a prime power, else `0`. Built with no primality predicate beyond the **smallest factor**
  `spf n` (least `d ≥ 2` dividing `n`) and a prime-power test (strip `spf` to `1`). Everything is
  computable, so the defining values hold by reduction: `Λ(1) = 0`, `Λ(2) = Λ(4) = Λ(8) = log 2`,
  `Λ(3) = Λ(9) = log 3`, `Λ(6) = 0`; and `Λ ≥ 0` everywhere (`vonMangoldt_nonneg`).
- **`spf` is proved to be the least PRIME factor** — `spf_dvd` (it divides `n`), `spf_two_le` (`≥ 2`),
  and `spf_prime` (its only divisors are `1` and itself), via the fuel-sufficient search specification
  `spfFrom_spec`. So `Λ` is genuinely the von Mangoldt function (not a table matching at sampled
  points): `vonMangoldt_prime` gives `Λ(p) = log p` for **every** prime `p`.
- **The explicit-formula prime side** — `primeSide h N = Σ_{n=2}^N Λ(n)·h(log n)`, the prime side
  `Σ_p Σ_k log p · h(k·log p)` reindexed through `k·log p = log(pᵏ) = log n`. A finite sum, hence a
  genuine constructive real with **no convergence hypothesis**; `primeSide_stable` proves it is constant
  past the support cutoff, so a **compactly supported** `h` gives a single well-defined real
  (`primeTerm_zero_of_h` derives term-support from `h`-support).
- **The Bombieri–Lagarias decomposition of `λ₁`** (`F1Square/Analysis/LiOne.lean`) —
  `Rlambda1_decomposition : λ₁ ≈ λ₁^{arith} + λ₁^{∞}`, the two-place split of the explicit formula:
  - `Rlambda1_arith = γ` — the **finite/arithmetic place** `S_f(1) = −η₀` (`η₀ = −γ`; the regularized
    von Mangoldt / prime-power contribution).
  - `Rlambda1_arch = 1 − γ/2 − ½·log(4π)` — the **archimedean Gamma-factor place** `S_∞(1)` (incl. the
    trivial-pole "1").
  - proved by reducing both `λ₁ = ½·(2 + γ − log 4π)` and `arith + arch` to the canonical form
    `(1 + γ/2) − ½·log(4π)` via the pointwise `Rhalf` distribution (`Rhalf_Radd`, `Rhalf_Rneg`,
    `Rhalf_two`) and `γ − γ/2 ≈ γ/2` (`Rhalf_double`).
- **`Li.LiDecomposition` is now realized non-trivially** — `li_decomposition_realized`:
  `LiDecomposition liLamSeq liArithSeq liArchSeq`, a proven instance whose `n = 1` slice is the genuine
  arithmetic/archimedean split (`Rlambda1_decomposition`), promoting the interface from the trivial
  inhabitant `λ = λ + 0` (`Li.liDecomposition_genuine`).

### Honest scope (unchanged)
- Deriving the value `S_f(1) = γ` *from* the prime sum needs `ζ'/ζ` and its analytic continuation
  (v0.16.0+), so the Bombieri–Lagarias value is stated faithfully and **not** identified with the
  built `primeSide` — nothing is fabricated. None of this bears on positivity: the crux
  `liPositivityHolds` stays `none` and **RH stays open**. Critical strip, zeros, and the genuine `λₙ`
  for `n ≥ 2` remain deferred.
- All new theorems are choice-free (`{propext, Quot.sound}`), audited in `scripts/audit_axioms.lean`;
  the build is green and the honesty gate passes (coverage: 1211 proof-layer theorems).

## [0.15.2] - 2026-06-10

### Added — ζ(s) = Σ n⁻ˢ for **complex** s with Re s > 1, as a genuine constructive ℂ (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- **The Riemann zeta function for complex argument** (`F1Square/Analysis/ComplexZeta.lean`) — `Czeta s hσ … hθ`:
  for any complex `s` with `Re s ≥ 0` and a rational witness `τ > 0` of `Re s > 1` (`τ ≤ (Re s − 1)·log 2`),
  `ζ(s) = Σ_{n≥1} n⁻ˢ` is a genuine constructive complex number — its real and imaginary parts are Bishop
  diagonal limits (`Rlim`) of the reindexed dyadic partial sums `Σ_{n<2^{M(j)}} Re/Im(n⁻ˢ)`. This replaces
  the previous integer-only `ζ(s)` (`Σ 1/iˢ`, `s ≥ 2`): convergence now holds across the **full half-plane
  `Re s > 1`**, with `s` genuinely complex.
- **Convergence with a rate** — `Czeta_re_tendsTo` / `Czeta_im_tendsTo`: the partial sums converge to
  `Re/Im ζ(s)` with the canonical Bishop modulus `2/(k+1)` (`Rlim_tendsTo`). The rigorous complex geometric
  tail, certified.
- **The dyadic-geometric convergence proof**, built from scratch:
  - **exp injectivity → log-multiplicativity** (`F1Square/Analysis/RealPow.lean`) — `RexpReal_inj`,
    `logN_mul`, `logN_pow_two` (`log(2ᵏ) = k·log 2`), re-routing around the artanh addition boundary wall.
  - **dyadic block bound** — `czetaExp_block_geo`: the `[2ᵏ, 2ᵏ⁺¹)` block modulus `≤ ofQ(rᵏ)`,
    `r = 1/(1+τ) < 1` (the ratio `2·exp(−σ log2) = exp(−θ) ≤ r`, from `Re s > 1`).
  - **geometric tail** — `geoFrom_telescope` (`Σ_{k=j}^{j+d−1} rᵏ·(1−r) = rʲ − r^{j+d}`), `geoFrom_le`
    (`≤ rʲ/(1−r)`), and the dyadic telescoping `czetaExp_tail` (`E(2^{j+d}) − E(2ʲ) ≤ ofQ(Σ rᵏ)`).
  - **the geometric reindex** — `geom_reindex`: the Bernoulli `1/(linear)` decay `qpow_geom_bound` with the
    quadratic index `M(j) = (j+1)·r.den²` collapses `r^{M(j)}/(1−r) ≤ 1/(j+1)` (`czetaExp_tail_reindex`).
  - **the completeness bridge** — `seq_diff_le` (a real upper bound `a − b ≤ c` gives the same-index rational
    bound `aₙ − bₙ ≤ c + 2/(n+1)`, via regularity + the generalized Archimedean lemma) and `RReg_of_real_bound`
    (pairwise real differences `≤ 1/(j+1)+1/(k+1)` ⟹ a regular sequence of reals), feeding Bishop's `Rlim`.
  - **the Cauchy partial sums** — `czetaRe_RReg` / `czetaIm_RReg`: the reindexed real/imaginary partial sums
    are regular sequences of reals (the four two-sided tail bounds `czetaRe/Im_tail_le/ge`, case-split on `j ≤ k`).
- **Non-vacuity** — `czeta_two_theta` + a fully-closed `F1Square.lean` instance: `ζ(2) = Σ 1/n²` is built as
  `Czeta` and its partial sums converge (the `Re s > 1` hypothesis is satisfiable, `τ = 1/2 ≤ log 2`).
- **Full-sequence convergence** (not just the dyadic subsequence) — `czetaExp_mono` (E monotone),
  `czetaExp_tail_full` / `czetaRe`,`czetaIm_tail_full(_neg)` (the tail bound for *arbitrary* `N ≥ 2^{M(j)}`),
  `czetaRe`/`czetaIm_cauchy_full` (the **whole** partial-sum sequence is uniformly Cauchy: `|S(N) − S(N')| ≤
  2/(j+1)` for all `N, N' ≥ 2^{M(j)}`), and `czetaRe`/`czetaIm_full_tendsTo` (`|S(N) − ζ(s)| ≤ 3/(k+1)`). So
  `Σ_{n=1}^N n⁻ˢ` converges as a genuine series for every `N`, not merely along `2^{M(k)}`.
- **Canonicity** — `Czeta_re_canonical` / `Czeta_im_canonical`: `ζ(s)` is independent of the convergence
  witness `τ` (any two witnesses give `≈`-equal values — both are the limit of the same full sequence, via
  `RTendsTo_to_Rle` and the real-level Archimedean `Req_of_Rle_ofQ_all`). So `ζ(s)` is a well-defined function
  of `s` alone on `Re s > 1`.
- **`F1Square.lean` witnesses** binding `Czeta_re/im_tendsTo`, the concrete `ζ(2)`, the full-sequence Cauchy
  property, and canonicity — all for complex `s` with `Re s > 1`.
- Choice-free throughout (`{propext, Quot.sound}` only), `sorry`-free, `#print axioms`-audited at every commit.

### Unchanged — the honesty audit
- The crux `liPositivityHolds = none` (= RH) stays open; ζ ships in its convergent half-plane `Re s > 1`
  (where it has no zeros), and the analytic continuation to the critical strip is not built.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added — the ζ-convergence gate `exp∘log = id` via genuine power-series composition (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- **`exp(2·artanh τ) = (1+τ)/(1−τ)` at the real level** (`F1Square/Analysis/ExpLog.lean`) —
  `Rexp_two_artanh_ofQ`: `RexpReal (TwoArtanhConst τ) ≈ (1+τ)/(1−τ)` for a constant rational `τ` (`0 ≤ τ < 1`).
  This is the roadmap's **research-grade base identity** (v0.15.1), built from scratch as a power-series
  composition — the elementary squeeze `1 + log x ≤ exp(log x) ≤ 1/(1−log x)` never pins equality, so the
  exp factorial series is composed with the artanh geometric series directly. The analytic core: the
  composition **corner bound** `exp_corner_le` (via finite-support truncation `truncTo`, the no-corner power
  `peval_fpow_pow_eq`, and the corner inequality `qpow_peval_le`), the formal-ODE identity `formal_exp_geom`
  (`fcomp ecoef (2·acoef) = dgeom`, by multiplicative-ODE uniqueness `fderiv_mul_inj`), the geometric closed
  form (`dgeom_geom_gap_le`), and the **rational identity** `exp_artanh_rat_cleared`. Lifted to the reals by
  the **diagonal reconciliation** `Rexp_two_artanh_via` (mirrors `RexpReal_congr`: a Lipschitz `P_match`
  matching the artanh inner depth to the exp outer depth via `peval_twoacoef_cauchy` + `expSum_Lip_le`/
  `LipS_le_U`, plus the `exp_artanh_recip` tail), with the argument-magnitude bounds `peval_twoacoef_abs_le_gpow`
  and `two_gPow_le`, and the clearing-division helper `mul_div_gen`.
- **`exp(log n) = n` for the *literal* `Rlog` term** (`F1Square/Analysis/ExpLog.lean`) — `Rexp_log_nat_Rlog`:
  `RexpReal (Rlog (ofQ n) …) ≈ n`, where `Rlog (ofQ n)` is the actual constructive logarithm
  `2·artanh((n−1)/(n+1))`. The base construction `RartanhConst`/`TwoArtanhConst`/`Rexp_two_artanh_ofQ` is
  **radius-general** (the convergence radius enters only through the depth reindex, which `Rexp_two_artanh_via`
  abstracts), so it applies directly at `Rlog`'s own smaller radius `ρ_M = (n−1)/(n+1)`, and
  `Rlog (ofQ n) = TwoArtanhConst (tmap n) ρ_M` holds by `rfl` (definitional equality of the constant-sequence
  artanh arguments). No `τ²≤½` smallness is needed. (`Rexp_log_nat` gives the same at the convenience radius
  `ρ = τ`.) The `tmap`-arithmetic (`1−τ = 2/(n+1)`, `g·(1−τ) = 1+τ`, `K·(1−τ) = 1`) is pure ℚ (`tmap_nat_den`/`num`).
- **Why it matters.** This closes the discovered dependency of stage A: `Σ n^{-s}` converges because
  `|n^{-s}| = n^{-Re s}`, i.e. `exp(log n) = n`. The honesty gate is met — the identity closes **axiom-clean**
  (`{propext, Quot.sound}` only), so the ζ-complex tail (v0.15.2) need not ship its convergence as an interface.
- **The crux stays `none`; RH is open.** `liPositivityHolds`/`hodgeIndexHolds` remain `none`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added — the complex analytic engine (stage A, exponential core): `exp` is a homomorphism, `nˢ` and its modulus (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- **The exponential functional equation on all of ℝ** (`F1Square/Analysis/ExpRealAdd.lean`) — `RexpReal_add`:
  `exp(x+y) ≈ exp x · exp y` for arbitrary constructive reals, the roadmap's technical core of stage A.
  Built from scratch as the diagonal lift of the rational Cauchy-product functional equation: the
  general-argument corner bound (`expSum_corner_le_gen`), its **signed** generalization
  (`expSum_corner_le_gen_signed`, `expSum_add_le_signed` — constructive-real samples dip negative even for
  positive reals), the exp diagonal reconciliations (`expSum_reconcile`, `rexp_factor_reconcile`), the uniform
  partial-sum bound (`expSum_abs_le_Un`), the factorial decay at the diagonal depth (`RexpReal_trunc_le`), and
  the deep-reference assembly (`rexp_add_gap`, `RexpReal_add_aux`). General exp-tail decay lemmas
  (`npow_fct_decay`, `truncCoef_Q/QE`) relocated to `ExpReal` for shared use.
- **The Pythagorean identity `cos² + sin² ≈ 1`** (`F1Square/Analysis/CosSinAdd.lean`) — `Rcos_sq_add_sin_sq`
  via the trigonometric Cauchy product from scratch, and its corollary **`|cos| ≤ 1`, `|sin| ≤ 1`**
  (`F1Square/Analysis/CosSinBound.lean`, `Rcos_sq_le_one`/`Rsin_sq_le_one`, through `Rnonneg_Rmul_self`).
- **The complex exponential `e^z`** (`F1Square/Analysis/ComplexExp.lean`) — `Cexp z = exp(re z)·(cos(im z) +
  i·sin(im z))` with component identities and `Cexp 0 ≈ 1` (`Cexp_zero`, `RexpReal_zero`, `Rcos_zero`,
  `Rsin_zero`).
- **`nˢ` and the modulus identity** (`F1Square/Analysis/ComplexMod.lean`, `ComplexPow.lean`) — `ncpow n s =
  Cexp(s·log n)` (positive-integer base via the real `RlogNat`), and `|Cexp z|² = (exp Re z)²` (`Cexp_normSq`,
  the analytic payoff of `cos²+sin²=1`) / `|nˢ|² = (exp(Re s·log n))²` (`ncpow_normSq`) — the squared modulus
  depends only on `Re s`, the basis of the future ζ tail bound.
- **The crux stays `none`; RH is open.** This release ships the *exponential core* of stage A. ζ for complex
  argument is **not** shipped: its convergence is gated on `exp(log n) = n` (`exp∘log = id`), a power-series
  composition that — because `log` is built independently as `2·artanh((x−1)/(x+1))` — is not definitional and
  is scoped to the **v0.15.x** series (see `ROADMAP.md`). `liPositivityHolds`/`hodgeIndexHolds` remain `none`.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added — the analytic constants of the Li/Keiper bridge, and a positivity certificate for λ₁ (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- **π as a constructive real** (`F1Square/Analysis/Pi.lean`) — `Rpi` via Machin's formula
  `π = 16·arctan(1/5) − 4·arctan(1/239)` as a single Bishop-regular diagonal (`Arctan.lean` supplies the
  alternating arctan series on `[−ρ,ρ]`, `ρ<1`). Lower bracket `Rpi_lower` (π ≥ 6/5) gives `Pos Rpi`;
  the tight `Rpi_seq_ub_tight` (π ≤ 3.142) comes from the one-sided arctan truncation
  `arctanSum_deep_le`/`arctanSum_deep_ge` at the tightest radius `ρ = t`.
- **`log 2`, `log π`, `log 4π`** (`F1Square/Analysis/GammaAccel.lean`) — clean `2·artanh((x−1)/(x+1))`
  logs `Rlog2c`, `Rlogπc`, with kernel-certified upper bounds `Rlog2c_le` (`log 2 ≤ 0.6931`) and
  `Rlogπc_le` (`log π ≤ 1.1453`). The varying `π`-argument is dominated by the constant `15/29 = tmap(22/7)`
  (`artSum_base_mono`, since `π ≤ 22/7`), then truncated with an explicit geometric tail (`artSum_le_value`).
- **Euler–Mascheroni γ, convergence-accelerated** (`F1Square/Analysis/GammaAccel.lean`) — `Rgamma_h`, the
  harmonic-telescoped `γ = Σ(1/i − 2·artanh(1/(2i+1)))`, with the kernel-certified lower bracket
  `Rgamma_h_lower` (γ ≥ 0.54). This route is *feasible* where the alternating-ζ-series γ is not: that
  series carries the running `lcm` denominator (already `gammaSeq 2` has ~7000 digits), so a positivity
  certificate from it was out of computational reach.
- **`Pos λ₁` — the first Li coefficient is a positivity-certified constructive real**
  (`F1Square/Analysis/LambdaOne.lean`) — `Rlambda1 = ½·(2 + γ − log 4π)` (Bombieri–Lagarias), with
  `Rlambda1_pos : Pos Rlambda1`. Proven through `2λ₁ = 2 + γ − log 4π` (integer coefficients):
  `2λ₁ ≥ (2 + 0.54) − (2·0.6931 + 1.1453) = 0.0084 > 0`, hence `λ₁ ≥ 0.0042 > 0`. The ℝ-order bridges
  `Radd_le_add`, `Rneg_le`, `Rhalf`/`Rhalf_ge` carry the rational bounds through the ring operations.
- **The crux stays `none`; RH is open.** `λ₁ > 0` is the `n = 1` slice of Li's criterion realized as
  **evidence** — it does **not** assert `λₙ > 0 ∀ n` (which *is* RH). `liPositivityHolds` and
  `hodgeIndexHolds` remain `none`, never asserted. De-hedging here removes false modesty about the proven
  `λ₁` result (its certificate was previously documented as computationally infeasible); it adds no
  confidence about RH.
- All new theorems are `#print axioms`-audited and choice-free (`{propext, Quot.sound}`).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added — the transcendentals on ℝ: `cos`, `sin`, and `log` on positive reals (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- **`cos` / `sin` on ℝ** (`F1Square/Analysis/CosSin.lean`) — the alternating power series as a directly
  Bishop-regular diagonal `RaltReal x off = ⟨Σ (−x²)ⁿ/(2n+off)!⟩`. The alternating term is dominated by
  the exponential of `M²` (`altTerm_abs_le`, `fct_mono`, `qsq_abs_le`), giving the truncation bound
  `altSum_trunc_bound` (geometric/factorial tail) and the Lipschitz bound `altSum_Lip_le`; the diagonal
  is regular (`RaltReal_regular`). `Rcos = RaltReal x 0`, `Rsin = x · RaltReal x 1`.
- **`log` on positive reals, positivity-as-data** (`F1Square/Analysis/Log.lean`) —
  `RlogPos x k = 2·artanh((x−1)/(x+1))` from a positivity witness `x_k > 1/(k+1)`, the *same* idiom as
  the reciprocal `Rinv`: the rational modulus `1/M ≤ x ≤ M` (`M = |x₀| + 2 + 1/L`, `L = δ/2` the witness
  floor via `Rinv_lb`) is **derived**, not demanded of the caller. (Constructively a modulus *is*
  necessary — `log` has no uniform modulus of continuity on `(0,∞)`.) The explicit-modulus engine
  `Rlog x M` takes `M` directly (`Rlog_two_ok` exhibits it on `x ≡ 2`):
  - **`artanh` on every `[−ρ,ρ]`, `ρ<1`** (`Rartanh`): the odd series `Σ t^{2n+1}/(2n+1)` as a regular
    diagonal, via the geometric telescoping `geo_diff_bound`, the truncation `artSum_trunc`, the
    Lipschitz `artSum_Lip_le` (with `geoEven_bound`), and the **general Bernoulli reindex**
    `qpow_geom_bound` (`ρᵐ ≤ q/(q+m(q−p))`) that tames the geometric tail.
  - **the t-map `q ↦ (q−1)/(q+1)`**: its cleared difference identity `tmap_diff_cleared`
    (`(tmap a − tmap b)·(a+1)(b+1) = 2(a−b)`), the Lipschitz bound `tmap_lipschitz`
    (`|tmap a − tmap b| ≤ (2/(L+1)²)·|a−b|`), and the range bound `tmap_abs_le`
    (`|tmap q| ≤ tmap M` for `q ∈ [1/M, M]`, keeping the artanh argument inside `[−ρ,ρ]`).
  - the diagonal `t.seq n = tmap(x_{2(n+1)})` is regular because the t-map is 2-Lipschitz on `x ≥ 0`
    (`Rlog_regular`); `tmap_M_eq` identifies the radius `ρ = tmap M < 1`.

### Changed — axiom-minimization (the axiom footprint cannot be a peer-review weakness)
- The entire proof layer is now **choice-free**: `Classical.choice` is eliminated. The only remaining
  axioms are `{propext, Quot.sound}`, both forced by `omega`/`simp`/`Int` core internals and
  constructively uncontroversial. (The two theorems that pulled choice did so only because `omega`
  discharged an `↔` goal directly; splitting into `Iff.intro` per direction is choice-free.)
- `scripts/honesty_audit.sh` tightened: the allowlist drops `Classical.choice`, so any future
  re-introduction of choice (or any other named axiom) fails CI. Coverage 399/399, enforced.

### Unchanged — the honest demarcation
- The crux stays `none` on both faces (`hodgeIndexHolds`, `liPositivityHolds`); RH is **open**
  (June 2026) and is never asserted. The transcendentals make more of the analytic half *statable and
  checkable*; they do not touch the crux.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — ℝ as a constructive field with powers, and `exp` on all of ℝ (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- **Real field / powers** (the multiplicative substrate the transcendentals need):
  - `F1Square/Analysis/Pow.lean` — real powers `Rpow` (iterated `Rmul`) with `Rpow_one`, `Rpow_congr`
    (powers respect `≈`).
  - `F1Square/Analysis/Inv.lean` — the reciprocal `1/x` of a positive real, **positivity-as-data**: from
    a witness `k` with `x_k > 1/(k+1)`, floor `x` by `L = δ/2 > 0` on the tail and reindex
    `R n = 4δ.den²(n+1) + 2δ.den`; `RinvSeq_regular` assembles full Bishop regularity. Plus the rational
    reciprocal `Qinv` (inverse law `a·(1/a) ≈ 1`, antitonicity, the difference identity
    `1/a − 1/b = (b−a)·(1/a)·(1/b)`) and division `Rdiv`.
  - `QOrder.lean` gains `Qmul_congr` and `Qmul_add_right` (ℚ multiplication respects `≈`; right
    distributivity).
- **`exp` on ℝ** (`F1Square/Analysis/ExpReal.lean`) — the everywhere-defined real exponential, as the
  **diagonal of rational partial sums**: `exp(x)_j = S_{R j}(x_{R j})` with `S_N(q) = Σ_{i≤N} qⁱ/i!`
  and a single reindex `R j` for both argument index and truncation depth. The diagonal sequence of
  rationals is itself Bishop-regular (`RexpReal_regular`: `|exp(x)_j − exp(x)_k| ≤ 1/(j+1)+1/(k+1)`), so
  it *is* a constructive real directly. Its three rational ingredients, all axiom-clean:
  - **truncation bound** `expSum_trunc_bound` — `|S_q(b) − S_q(a)| ≤ 2Mᵃ⁺¹/(a+1)!` for `|q| ≤ M`,
    `2M ≤ a ≤ b` (the dominating `M`-series `expSumM` with its telescoping tail `expM_diff_bound`, and
    termwise domination of the general-`q` gap);
  - **Lipschitz bound** `expSum_Lip_le` + `LipS_le_U` — `|S_q(N) − S_{q'}(N)| ≤ C·|q − q'|` with `C`
    uniform in `N` (per-power `|qⁱ − q'ⁱ| ≤ i·Mⁱ⁻¹·|q−q'|`, summed);
  - **factorial-growth** `fct_ge_geom` + `trunc_reindex` — the super-fast factorial tail converts to a
    `1/(j+1)` reindex.
- `F1Square.lean` gains the v0.12.0 manifest mapping + an elaboration-checked `example` (real powers
  `x¹ ≈ x`; `exp` is genuinely constructed with its rigorous diagonal gap bound).
  `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended (coverage 341/341, enforced); honesty audit PASS, axiom-clean.

### Note
- This completes the field/powers + `exp` substrate. Next: **v0.13.0** `cos`/`sin` + `log` (prereqs —
  `Rinv`, `qpow` with its bounds, ℝ-completeness — are all in place). Then the next phase: ζ's
  continuation into the critical strip (needs complex exp/log), the genuine `λₙ` realizing the v0.10.0
  interfaces, and the explicit-formula trace, ending at `λₙ > 0 ∀n` = RH (the open frontier). RH remains
  open (June 2026); no 𝔽₁-square construction exists.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — the order `≤` on constructive ℝ (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`): the foundation for the transcendentals
- `F1Square/Analysis/ROrder.lean` — **`Rle`**, the Bishop order `x ≤ y ⟺ ∀ n, xₙ ≤ yₙ + 2/(n+1)`,
  with the genuine order laws: `Rle_refl`, `Rle_of_Req` (`≈ ⟹ ≤`), `Rle_antisymm` (`x ≤ y` and
  `y ≤ x` ⟹ `x ≈ y`), and **`Rle_trans`** — the one genuine limiting step: chaining `x ≤ y ≤ z`
  through an auxiliary index `m` gives `xₙ ≤ zₙ + 2/(n+1) + 6/(m+1)` for every `m`, and the generalized
  Archimedean lemma `Qarch_gen` kills the `6/(m+1)` tail (the argument behind `Req_trans`).
- **`Rnonneg` canonicalized** here (moved from `Li`): Bishop `x ≥ 0` (`−1/(n+1) ≤ xₙ`), with
  `Rnonneg_zero`/`Rnonneg_one`/`Rnonneg_Radd`, and `Rle_zero_of_Rnonneg` (`x ≥ 0 ⟹ 0 ≤ x`).
- ℚ signed-bound helpers (`Qle_self_Qabs`, `Qabs_le_of_both`, `Qle_add_of_Qabs_sub`,
  `Qsub_le_of_le_add`); `Qle_self_add`/`Qle_add_self` moved to `QOrder` (their natural home).
- `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.11.0 `example`; `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended (coverage 288/288,
  enforced); the honesty gate is hardened to also fail on **duplicate proof-layer theorem short-names**;
  honesty audit PASS, axiom-clean and choice-free.

### Note
- This is the foundation the transcendentals build on. The roadmap for the rest, concretely (no open
  `+`): **v0.12.0** reciprocal `Rinv` + `exp` on ℝ; **v0.13.0** `cos`/`sin` + `log`; then the next
  phase — ζ's continuation into the critical strip (needs complex exp/log), the genuine `λₙ` realizing
  the v0.10.0 interfaces, and the explicit-formula trace, which ends at `λₙ > 0 ∀n` = RH (the open
  frontier). RH remains open (June 2026); no 𝔽₁-square construction exists.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — the λₙ / Riemann-Hypothesis proof boundary, locked faithfully (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- `F1Square/Li.lean` — the **analytic face** of the same crux `Crux.lean` states geometrically. By
  **Li's criterion** (Li 1997), RH ⟺ `λₙ > 0` for all `n ≥ 1` (the paired sum over the nontrivial
  zeros; the non-strict `≥ 0` form is the general Bombieri–Lagarias 1999 multiset criterion, also
  ⟺ RH). This brick states that boundary precisely, before ζ is built, so the proof boundary is pinned.
- **Bishop ℝ order**: `Rnonneg` (the non-strict `x ≥ 0`, companion to the existing strict `Pos`), with
  `Rnonneg_zero`, `Rnonneg_one`, `Pos_one`, and the generic `Rnonneg_Radd` (sum of non-negatives is
  non-negative — *explicitly disclaimed* as **not** the mechanism behind Li-positivity, since the
  Bombieri–Lagarias parts `λₙ^{arith} = −Σ Λ(m)wₙ(m)` and `λₙ^{∞}` have opposite signs and `λₙ > 0` is
  a delicate cancellation, which is the open difficulty).
- **The Li-positivity property** `LiPositive` (strict, ζ-specific) and `LiNonneg` (BL non-strict),
  proven genuine/satisfiable by `template_liPositive`/`template_liNonneg` (the constant-`1` sequence) —
  the analytic analogue of `Crux.template_hodgeIndex`.
- **The finite-check guard** `liPositive_iff_all_upTo`: `LiPositive lam ↔ ∀ N, LiPositiveUpTo lam N`.
  This encodes precisely why the numerical positivity of the first ~10⁵ Li coefficients (computed to
  n = 100 000, Feb 2025) is **not** a proof: the theorem is the universal `∀ N`, which no finite
  `decide` reaches.
- **THE CRUX (analytic face)** `LiCrux λ` for the unconstructed genuine ζ-derived Li sequence — OPEN,
  never asserted, never axiomatized. A detailed **faithfulness caution** forbids the standard traps
  (existential witness, manifestly-positive definition, finite/truncated `decide`); `LiPositive λ ⟺ RH`
  is [CLASSICAL] (Li 1997), and positivity reformulations do not make RH easier (Conrey–Li 2000).
- **ζ-layer substrate as honest interfaces** (genuine/inhabited, never asserted for the real `λ`):
  `LiDecomposition` (Bombieri–Lagarias), `ExplicitFormulaTrace` (Weil 1952 / Connes 1999), `LiAgreesWith`.

### Added — ζ and λₙ as exact-bounded objects
- `F1Square/Analysis/ExactBounded.lean` — **`ExactBoundedReal`**: a constructive real presented as a
  stream of certified rational enclosures `[xₙ − 1/(n+1), xₙ + 1/(n+1)]`, with the exact-width identity
  `enclosure_width` (`upperB − lowerB = 2/(n+1)`), `lowerB_le_upperB`, and the regularity `certificate`.
  The Li coefficients are typed `λ : Nat → ExactBoundedReal`.
- `F1Square/Analysis/Zeta.lean` — **`ζ(s)` for integer `s ≥ 2` as a genuine exact-bounded constructive
  real**: `Σ_{i≥1} 1/iˢ` (natural powers `npow` from scratch), with the rigorous rational tail bound
  `zetadiff_bound` (`S(b) − S(a) ≤ 1/(a+1)` for `a ≤ b`) via the telescoping decreasing
  `U(N) := S(N) + 1/(N+1)` (the added term `1/(N+2)ˢ ≤ 1/((N+1)(N+2))` since `(N+1)(N+2) ≤ (N+2)ˢ`).
  The bound is already the Bishop modulus, so the partial sums are directly regular (`zetaSeq_regular`,
  no reindex). `zeta_pos`: `ζ(s) > 0`. **Honest scope:** this is ζ in the convergent half-plane
  `Re(s) > 1` at integer points — where ζ has **no zeros** and RH does **not** live; the analytic
  continuation to the critical strip (and ζ at complex `s`) is **not** built, and the genuine `λₙ`
  *values* (needing the continuation + `log`) are not fabricated — only their exact-bounded *type* and
  the boundary are shipped.
- `F1Square.lean`: the status roll-up `F1SquareStatus` gains `liPositivityHolds := none` — the analytic
  face of RH, alongside the geometric `hodgeIndexHolds := none`. Both crux faces are `none`. New v0.10.0
  mapping + two elaboration-checked `example`s (the Li boundary; ζ as an exact-bounded object);
  `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended (coverage now 279/279, enforced); honesty audit PASS,
  axiom-clean and choice-free.

### Note
- RH remains **open** (June 2026); Li-positivity is unproven for all `n` (only finite ranges checked
  numerically). No 𝔽₁-square construction exists. This brick makes the analytic boundary *statable and
  checkable* — it does not, and cannot here, prove `λₙ > 0 ∀n`, which is RH.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — the general exponential `exp(q)` on the rational interval `[0,1]` (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`, choice-free)
- `F1Square/Analysis/ExpGen.lean` — **`exp(q) = Σ qⁱ/i!` for rational `q ∈ [0,1]`, as a constructive
  real**, with a rigorous rational error bound. This continues the transcendentals arc opened by
  `e = exp(1)` (v0.8.0) and reuses its machinery almost verbatim — the only genuinely new input is
  **termwise domination**: for `q ∈ [0,1]` every power `qⁱ ≤ 1`, so each term `qⁱ/i! ≤ 1/i!`.
- **Rational powers from scratch** `qpow` (core has no `q^i`), with `qpow_le_one` (`q ∈ [0,1] ⇒ qⁱ ≤ 1`),
  `qpow_nonneg`, `qpow_den_pos`.
- **The domination bridge** `expTerm_le` (`qⁱ/i! ≤ 1/i!`) and `expdiff_dom` (the `exp(q)` partial-sum
  gaps are dominated termwise by those of `e`), giving the rigorous error bound `expdiff_bound`: for
  `a ≤ b`, `S_q(b) − S_q(a) ≤ 2/(a+1)!` — the *same* rational tail bound as `e`, no new tail analysis.
  The reindex `n ↦ S_q(n+1)` reuses `efct_reindex` verbatim, so `expSeq q` is regular
  (`expSeq_regular`) and `Rexp q` is a genuine constructive real.
- **Correctness anchors**: `Rexp_zero` (`exp 0 ≈ 1`), `Rexp_one_pos` (`exp 1 > 0`), and
  `Rexp_one_eq_e` (`exp 1 ≈ e` — the general construction specializes to v0.8.0's Euler number, a
  genuine regression anchor).
- `F1Square/Analysis/QOrder.lean` gains `Qeq_trans` (ℚ value-equality is an equivalence — the
  cross-multiplied identities are linear-combined and cancelled via `b.den > 0`), reusable infrastructure.
- `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended; the honesty gate stays green (every theorem
  `⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`; in fact choice-free; no `sorry`/`native_decide`/stray axiom).
  `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.9.0 `example`.

### Hardened (peer-review readiness)
- **Self-enforcing audit coverage.** `scripts/honesty_audit.sh` now mechanically checks that *every*
  non-private proof-layer `theorem`/`lemma` (248 of them) is `#print axioms`-audited in
  `audit_axioms.lean`, and fails CI otherwise. Previously the audit list was hand-maintained and ~30
  declarations (4 of them un-reachable leaf `rfl`-lemmas) were unlisted; all are now audited and the
  "every theorem is checked" invariant can no longer silently drift.
- **Honest prose pass.** Tightened documentation wording so sub-result status is unambiguous: T1 is
  scoped to "point-set level, surface unbuilt" (no longer "the 2D surface exists"); the §2.3
  shift-length finding leads with its *vacuity* (it equals RH, not a step toward it); the §9.1 lift is
  labelled as re-verification on genuine product surfaces `C × C` (not the unbuilt `𝕊`); the
  characteristic-1 status block distinguishes Lean kernel-checked (R1–R6, R9–R16) from
  numerically-checked (R7/R8). Stale `v0.0.1` publishing/citation instructions in `README.md` updated.

### Changed
- `docs/` roadmap re-paced within the transcendentals arc: v0.9.0 delivers `exp(q)` on `[0,1]`; the
  everywhere-defined `exp` on ℝ (via the halving/squaring identity `exp x = exp(x/2ᵏ)^{2ᵏ}`), `cos`/`sin`
  (alternating series with the even/odd sandwich remainder — genuinely new machinery), and `log`
  (positivity-as-data + the artanh series) follow in v0.10.0+.

### Note
- RH remains **open** (June 2026), and no construction of the 𝔽₁-square exists (fresh mid-2026
  synthesis: the Feb-2026 Connes–Consani *On the Jacobian of Spec ℤ̄* [arXiv:2602.15941] is a
  Jacobian/adele-class-space construction — a monoidal extension of the Picard group of the arithmetic
  curve — **not** the square and **not** an intrinsic intersection theory; nothing newer on that axis
  was found). The transcendentals make more of the analytic half *statable and checkable*, never
  proven — proving `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` / the Hodge index on 𝕊 is RH.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — the first transcendental: Euler's number `e` via the exponential series (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- `F1Square/Analysis/Exp.lean` — **`e = Σ 1/i!` as a constructive real**, with a rigorous rational
  error bound. Standing on completeness (a convergent series is a regular sequence of its partial
  sums); since the partial sums are *rational*, the reindexed partial-sum sequence is directly a
  regular sequence of rationals — a `Real`. Factorial is built from scratch (`fct`) because Lean core
  has no `Nat.factorial`.
- **The rigorous error bound** `ediff_bound`: for `a ≤ b`, the partial-sum gap `S(b) − S(a) ≤ 2/(a+1)!`,
  via the telescoping observation that `U(n) := S(n) + 2/(n+1)!` is **decreasing** (`eU_step`, since
  `2/(n+2)! ≤ 1/(n+1)!`) — a fully rational, explicitly computable tail bound. The reindex `n ↦ S(n+1)`
  makes `2/(n+2)! ≤ 1/(n+1)`, so `eSeq` is regular (`eSeq_regular`) and `e` is a genuine real.
- **`e_pos`**: `e` is positive (witnessed at index 0, where its approximant is `2`).
- `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended; the honesty gate stays green (every theorem
  `⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`; no `sorry`/`native_decide`/stray axiom).

### Changed
- `docs/` roadmap re-paced: the transcendentals are a multi-release **arc** — v0.8.0 delivers the
  exponential-series machinery and `e`; the general `exp(q)` (on `[0,1]`), `cos`/`sin` (alternating
  series), and `log` follow in v0.9.0+. `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.8.0 `example`.

### Note
- RH remains **open**, and no construction of the 𝔽₁-square exists (fresh mid-2026 synthesis: the
  Feb-2026 Connes–Consani *On the Jacobian of Spec ℤ̄* is an Arakelov–Picard reinterpretation, not the
  square; there is still no accepted 𝔽₁-scheme theory realizing `Spec ℤ ×_𝔽₁ Spec ℤ` with an intrinsic
  intersection theory). The transcendentals make more of the analytic half *statable and checkable*,
  never proven — proving `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` / the Hodge index on 𝕊 is RH.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — Cauchy completeness of ℝ (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`, choice-free)
- `F1Square/Analysis/Complete.lean` — **every regular sequence of reals converges**. A sequence
  `X : ℕ → Real` is **regular** (`RReg`) when `X j` and `X k` agree within `1/(j+1) + 1/(k+1)` as reals
  (`|(X j)ₙ − (X k)ₙ| ≤ 1/(j+1) + 1/(k+1) + 2/(n+1)`, the canonical modulus). The limit `Rlim X` is
  **Bishop's diagonal** `n ↦ (X(4n+3))_{4n+3}` — the `4n+3` reindex reads each real far enough out that
  the diagonal is itself a regular sequence of rationals (`RlimSeq_regular`), so `Rlim X` is a genuine
  constructive real. **Convergence with a rate** `Rlim_tendsTo`: `X k → Rlim X` within `1/(k+1)` (gap
  `≤ 2/(k+1) + 2/(n+1)`). **Uniqueness** `RTendsTo_unique`: limits are unique up to `≈` (via the
  generalized Archimedean lemma `Qarch_gen` + the linear-bound criterion `Req_of_lin_bound`).
- Supporting ℚ lemmas: `Qfrac_le` / `Qcollapse_le` (collapse a scaled-denominator sum to a unit
  fraction) and `Qabs_Qsub_comm` (`|a−b| = |b−a|`).
- The construction is **choice-free**: because the regular-sequence data carries its own modulus, the
  diagonal needs no countable choice (the `#print axioms` audit shows no `Classical.choice` — only
  `propext`, `Quot.sound`). `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended; the honesty gate stays green.

### Changed
- `docs/` roadmap re-paced: the **transcendentals** (exp/log/cos via convergent series with rigorous
  rational error bounds) — which stand directly on this completeness brick (a power series is a regular
  sequence of its partial sums) — move to v0.8.0. `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.7.0 `example`.

### Note
- RH remains **open**, and no construction of the 𝔽₁-square exists (fresh mid-2026 synthesis: the
  Feb-2026 Connes–Consani *On the Jacobian of Spec ℤ̄* is an Arakelov–Picard reinterpretation, not the
  square; there is still no accepted 𝔽₁-scheme theory realizing `Spec ℤ ×_𝔽₁ Spec ℤ` with an intrinsic
  intersection theory). Completeness makes the analytic half *statable and checkable*, never proven —
  proving `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` / the Hodge index on 𝕊 is RH.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — ℝ and ℂ are commutative rings up to `≈`; ℝ multiplication well-defined on the setoid (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- `F1Square/Analysis/QOrder.lean` — the **generalized Archimedean lemma** `Qarch_gen`: if
  `p ≤ q + C/(m+1)` for every `m` (any fixed coefficient `C : ℕ`), then `p ≤ q`. Plus `Qscale_le`,
  the bound-fraction monotonicity `c ≤ d, j ≤ k ⟹ c/(k+1) ≤ d/(j+1)`.
- `F1Square/Analysis/Real.lean` — **the linear-bound criterion** `Req_of_lin_bound` (Lemma A): if
  `|xₙ − yₙ| ≤ C/(n+1)` for every `n` (any constant `C`), then `x ≈ y` — our packaging of the Bishop
  ε-shift transitivity argument into one reusable engine that converts every reindex-mismatch into a
  clean `≈`. Supporting product-gap engine: `Rmul_gap` (`|x_a y_a − x_b y_b| ≤ L(s+t)/(n+1)`),
  `Rgap_le`/`Rcross_le` (collapse same/`≈`-cross gaps to scale `1/(n+1)`), `canon_bound_mul`/`canon_bound_le`.
- `F1Square/Analysis/Real.lean` — **ℝ is a commutative ring up to `≈`**: `Rmul_congr` (multiplication
  is well-defined on the Bishop setoid — the v0.5.0-deferred congruence, now proved), `Rmul_assoc`
  (triple product, nested product-gaps), `Rmul_distrib`, `Rmul_one`, `Radd_assoc`, `Rmul_zero`,
  `Radd_zero`, `Rsub_zero`; plus `Rmul_neg_left/right`, `Rmul_sub_distrib(_right)`, `Rmul_distrib_right`
  and the pointwise re-association lemmas (`Rsub_Radd_Radd`, `Radd_swap`, `Rreassoc_sub`, `Rreassoc_add`).
- `F1Square/Analysis/Complex.lean` — **ℂ is a commutative ring up to `≈`**: `Cadd_assoc`, `Cmul_one`,
  `Cmul_distrib`, and `Cmul_assoc` (the bilinear expansion of `(a+bi)(c+di)`, reduced via the ℝ ring
  laws to pointwise additive re-associations). Together with v0.5.0's `Cadd_comm`/`Cadd_neg`/`Cmul_comm`,
  ℂ now satisfies all commutative-ring axioms up to `≈`.
- `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended to all new theorems; the honesty gate stays green
  (every theorem `⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`; no `sorry`/`native_decide`/stray axiom).

### Changed
- `docs/` roadmap re-paced: **completeness** (every regular sequence of reals converges) and the
  **transcendentals** (exp/cos via convergent series with rigorous error bounds) move to v0.7.0, now
  that ℝ/ℂ are verified commutative rings. `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.6.0 `example`.

### Note
- RH remains **open**, and no construction of the 𝔽₁-square exists (fresh mid-2026 synthesis: the
  Feb-2026 Connes–Consani *On the Jacobian of Spec ℤ̄* is an Arakelov–Picard reinterpretation of the
  adele class space, not the square; tropical Hodge-index theory is mature geometrically but unbridged
  to the arithmetic setting). v0.6.0 finishes the ℝ/ℂ algebraic substrate (commutative rings up to
  `≈`); it makes the analytic half *statable and checkable*, never proven — proving `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` / the
  Hodge index on 𝕊 is RH.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — ℝ's equality is an equivalence, ℝ multiplication, ℂ = ℝ×ℝ (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- `F1Square/Analysis/QOrder.lean` — the **Archimedean lemma** `Qarch` (if `p ≤ q + 6/(m+1)` for all
  `m`, then `p ≤ q`), the 3-point triangle inequality, ℚ order totality, and the **ℚ
  multiplication-order library**: `Qabs_mul` (|ab|=|a||b|), non-negative product monotonicity
  `Qmul_le_mul`, and the product-difference triangle `Qabs_mul_diff`
  (`|x_a y_a − x_b y_b| ≤ |x_a||y_a−y_b| + |y_b||x_a−x_b|`).
- `F1Square/Analysis/Real.lean` — **`≈` is now a full equivalence**: transitivity `Req_trans` via the
  Archimedean lemma (the `2/(n+1) + 6/(m+1)` four-triangle argument). **ℝ multiplication** `Rmul`:
  reindex both factors at `r(n) = 2K(n+1)−1` with `K` the canonical bound `|xₙ| ≤ |x₀|+2`
  (`canon_bound`), regularity proved (the `2K` reindexing cancels the bound, via `ring_uor`);
  commutativity `Rmul_comm`. Plus `Rsub` and the additive-group laws `Radd_comm`, `Radd_neg`.
- `F1Square/Analysis/Real.lean` — **operation-congruence over `≈`**: `Rneg_congr`, `Radd_congr`,
  `Rsub_congr` (the operations are well-defined on the Bishop setoid — the prerequisite for the ℂ ring
  laws).
- `F1Square/Analysis/Complex.lean` — **ℂ = ℝ×ℝ** with componentwise Bishop equality (an equivalence,
  `Ceq_refl/symm/trans`) and **all four operations**: `Cadd`, `Cneg`, `Cmul` (`(ac−bd, ad+bc)`), the
  constants `0, 1, i`, and the embedding ℝ ↪ ℂ; the additive-group laws (`Cadd_comm`, `Cadd_neg`) and
  **commutative multiplication** `Cmul_comm` (up to `≈`, via the operation-congruences + `Rmul_comm`).
- `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended to all new theorems; the honesty gate stays green.

### Changed
- `Qsub`/`Qabs`/`Qlt` and the denominator-positivity helpers now live in `Analysis/Rat.lean` (basic
  ℚ operations). `docs/` roadmap advances; `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.5.0 `example`.

### Note
- RH remains **open**. v0.5.0 completes the ℝ/ℂ field arithmetic, makes Bishop equality an
  equivalence, and gives ℂ a commutative multiplication up to `≈`. The remaining ℂ ring laws
  (associativity, distributivity) need `Rmul`-congruence and `Rmul`-associativity — a reindex-
  reconciliation theorem — which, with completeness and the transcendentals, is the v0.6.0
  continuation. The substrate makes the analytic half *statable and checkable*, never proven —
  proving `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` / the Hodge index on 𝕊 is RH.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — a from-scratch `ring` tactic; ℚ as an ordered field; ℝ as an ordered additive group (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- `F1Square/Analysis/RingTac.lean` — **`ring_uor`, a from-scratch commutative-ring decision
  procedure**, the capstone of the v0.3.0 normalizer. A real Lean tactic (core metaprogramming,
  `Lean.Elab.Tactic` — *not* Mathlib): it reifies an integer equality goal into the `PExpr` syntax,
  applies the soundness lemma `nf_eq`, and discharges the residual `norm lhs = norm rhs` by `decide`.
  Reification is fuel-bounded (no `partial def`); the tactic only *builds* a `nf_eq` proof, so every
  goal it closes is as axiom-clean as `nf_eq`. (`ring` is confirmed absent from core; `push_cast` and
  `omega` are core and are used for cast/linear steps.)
- `F1Square/Analysis/QOrder.lean` — **ℚ as a verified ordered field**: reflexivity, transitivity
  (`Qle_trans`), `Qeq → Qle`, additive monotonicity (`Qadd_le_add`), the absolute-value triangle
  inequality (`Qabs_add_le`), `|·|` respects value-equality (`Qabs_Qeq`), order transport along `≈`
  (`Qle_congr_left/right`), and the telescoping triangle `|(a+b)−(c+d)| ≤ |a−c|+|b−d|`
  (`Qabs_sub_add4`) — the exact bound real addition consumes. Built from the core ℤ order/`natAbs`
  lemmas and `ring_uor`.
- `F1Square/Analysis/Real.lean` — **ℝ arithmetic with full regularity proofs**: negation `Rneg`
  (an isometry) and the reindexed **Bishop addition** `Radd` (`(x⊕y)ₙ = x₍₂ₙ₊₁₎+y₍₂ₙ₊₁₎`, regular
  because `2·1/(2k+2) = 1/(k+1)`, proved via the telescoping triangle + monotonicity + `ring_uor`).
  The `Real` structure now carries `den_pos` (every term has a positive denominator). With
  denominator-positivity helpers added to `Analysis/Rat.lean`.
- `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended to all new theorems; the honesty gate stays green.

### Changed
- `Real` gains the `den_pos` field; `ofQ` now takes a positivity proof (`zero`/`one`/`half` supply it
  by `decide`). `Qsub`/`Qabs` moved from `Real.lean` to `Analysis/Rat.lean` (basic ℚ operations).
- `docs/`: the analysis-substrate roadmap advances (ℝ is now an ordered additive group with a
  from-scratch `ring`); ℝ multiplication, `≈`-transitivity (an Archimedean argument), ℂ = ℝ×ℝ, and
  the transcendentals are the v0.5.0 continuation. `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.4.0 `example`.

### Note
- RH remains **open**. v0.4.0 makes ℝ an ordered additive group and gives the project a genuine
  `ring`; it does not resolve λₙ / Weil-positivity / the crux. The substrate makes the analytic half
  *statable and checkable*, never proven — proving `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` / the Hodge index on 𝕊 is RH.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — the analysis substrate, brick two: a ℤ ring normalizer + constructive ℝ (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- `F1Square/Analysis/RingNF.lean` — a **reflective commutative-ring normalizer over ℤ**: polynomial
  expressions (`PExpr`) get a **canonical form** (a sorted, merged `(monomial, coefficient)` list —
  their content-address), with a single soundness theorem `norm_sound : pden ρ (norm e) = denote ρ e`
  and the decision lemma `nf_eq` (equal canonical forms ⇒ equal as ℤ-functions). This lifts the
  no-`ring` ceiling: general nonlinear identities — `(a+b)² = a²+2ab+b²`, `(a+b)(a−b) = a²−b²`,
  `(a+b+c)²`, commuted distributivity — are now genuine theorems for ALL integers, proved by `decide`
  on the finite normal form. Soundness is built from the core ℤ ring lemmas, never assumed.
- `F1Square/Analysis/Rat.lean` — the v0.2.0 ℚ brick's field laws are now **general** (all rationals,
  not just numerals): `add_comm`, `mul_comm`, `add_assoc`, `mul_assoc`, `mul_add` (distributivity),
  `mul_one`, `add_zero`, `add_neg` — each discharged by the ring normalizer after pushing the
  `Nat → Int` casts to the leaves. Dogfooding the v0.3.0 tool.
- `F1Square/Analysis/Real.lean` — **constructive ℝ** as **Bishop regular sequences** over the exact ℚ
  (`|xₘ − xₙ| ≤ 1/(m+1) + 1/(n+1)`): the `Real` type, the regularity predicate, the canonical
  embedding ℚ ↪ ℝ (proved regular and value-respecting, `const_regular` / `ofQ_respects`), the Bishop
  equality setoid (`Req_refl`, `Req_symm`), and the witnessed positivity predicate (`Pos`, `Pos_half`).
- `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended to all 29 new theorems; the honesty gate stays green.

### Changed
- `docs/`: the analysis-substrate roadmap advances one brick (ℚ → **ℤ ring normalizer + ℝ** →
  ℂ+transcendentals → ζ/λₙ); the v0.3.0 status is recorded. `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.3.0
  elaboration-checked `example`. Literature note refreshed (the Feb-2026 Connes–Consani *Jacobian of
  `Spec ℤ̄`*, arXiv:2602.15941, is Arakelov–Picard — it does **not** construct the square or prove
  Hodge positivity; RH remains open as of mid-2026).

### Note
- RH remains **open**. v0.3.0 builds the algebraic tool (the ring normalizer) and the ℝ foundation;
  ℝ arithmetic (`+`, `·`), `≈`-transitivity (a limiting argument), and completeness are the v0.4.0
  continuation. The substrate makes the analytic half *statable and checkable*, never proven —
  proving `λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n` / the Hodge index on 𝕊 is RH.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — finite tropical stack mechanized + first analysis brick (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- `F1Square/Tropical/Closure.lean` — tropical (max-plus) matrix closure: the canonical `W*` (matches
  the companion) and **R2** Kleene-star idempotence `W* ⊗ W* = W*`, by `decide`.
- `F1Square/Tropical/Spectrum.lean` — the content-address κ and the cycle-mean spectrum: **R3** κ
  permutation-invariance, **R4** the cycle spectrum, and the headline **R9/R10** κ⊥spectrum
  counterexample (same κ, different spectrum) with **R11** the κ-fiber.
- `F1Square/Tropical/Siblings.lean` — the boolean sibling carrier: **R14** κ permutation-invariance,
  **R15** the faceted `(κ_trop, κ_bool)` address, **R16** boolean-facet degeneracy on a
  strongly-connected graph.
- `F1Square/Tropical/Signature.lean` — tropical Hodge-index signatures: the §2.3 parallel pencil
  `Δ·Γ_n = 0` (`det((1,1),(1,1)) = 0`), the fan-vs-fiber correction (fan recession form degenerate,
  so `(1,ρ−1)` is the fiber form), and a Babaee–Huh counterexample (the signature is NOT automatic).
- `F1Square/Analysis/Rat.lean` — the first analysis brick: exact rationals ℚ from ℤ, the **UOR way**
  (canonical reduced form = content-address; decidable exact equality/order; idempotent `reduce`).
  The analysis-substrate roadmap (ℚ → constructive ℝ → ℂ+transcendentals → ζ/λₙ) is documented.
- `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` extended to all new theorems; the honesty gate stays green.

### Changed
- `docs/`: the finite R1–R16 stack is marked kernel-checked (was runtime-verified); the analysis
  roadmap and the v0.2.0 mechanization status are recorded. `F1Square.lean` gains a v0.2.0
  elaboration-checked `example`.

### Note
- RH remains **open**. v0.2.0 resolves the finite/decidable open questions and lays the ℚ brick; it
  does not resolve λₙ / Weil-positivity / the crux (those are RH). The analysis substrate makes them
  *statable and checkable*, not proven.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added — the genuine-proof layer (real Lean 4 theorems, no Mathlib, no `sorry`)
- `F1Square/Mechanism.lean` — the function-field Hodge mechanism as the square-root-free integer
  Hasse condition (`hodgeType_iff : hodgeType q a ↔ a² ≤ 4q`) with the §9.1 flip cases at
  `q = 4, 9, 25`; tropical intersection-positivity `mult = mu·mv·|det| ≥ 0` and tropical Bézout (R13).
- `F1Square/Template.lean` — the product-of-curves intersection template (§2.2): pairing symmetry,
  the sourced numbers `E₁·E₂ = 1`, `E₃² = −2`, the ample class `H² = 2 > 0`, and genuine
  negative-definiteness on the primitive complement `H^⊥` (`diag(−2,−2)`, nondegenerate) — the §1.4
  Hodge-type `(1,2)` decomposition.
- `F1Square/CharOne.lean` — the characteristic-1 (max-plus) base: idempotency (R1), the semiring
  laws, and the reversal theorem (R12: cycle weight/length invariant under reversal).
- `F1Square/CycleCounts.lean` — the Bowen–Lanford trace identity (R6) `N_m = tr(Bᵐ)` for the example
  graph, `N₁…N₈ = 0,2,6,2,10,14,14,34`, kernel-checked by `decide` on exact integer `Bᵐ`.
- `F1Square/Bridge.lean` — the mechanism bridge (Hodge type ⟹ spectral bound) and the §2.3 control
  mechanized (a rank-1 cos/sin Gram is PSD for ANY spectrum, so its positivity is vacuous w.r.t. RH).
- `F1Square/Crux.lean` — the crux stated faithfully: `HodgeIndex` proved for the Template
  (`template_hodgeIndex`); `CruxFor 𝕊` left OPEN (not forbidden) for the unconstructed square.
- `scripts/honesty_audit.sh` + `scripts/audit_axioms.lean` — the mechanized-honesty gate:
  `#print axioms` over every proof-layer theorem must show only `{propext, Classical.choice,
  Quot.sound}` — no `sorry` (sorryAx), no `native_decide` (ofReduceBool), no stray axioms. Wired into CI.
- `F1Square.lean` now imports the proof layer and carries an elaboration-checked `example` tying the
  manifest's established status fields to the genuine theorems; the crux field stays `none`.

### Changed
- `docs/f1_square_intersection_theory.md` §2 — citation corrections from an independent full-text
  verification (2026-06-06): Pietromonaco (not "Bryan et al.") for 1905.07085; Sagnier (not
  Connes–Consani) for 1703.10521; Moscovici added to the prolate paper; 2310.15367 is a 2023
  "tropical fans" preprint; the Feb-2026 *Jacobian of `Spec ℤ̄`* (2602.15941) proves moduli, **not**
  positivity; the deferred Hermitian-Jacobi computation (critical path to T5) has not appeared.

### Note
- The Riemann Hypothesis remains **open**. The crux (the Hodge index theorem for the 𝔽₁ square) is
  proved nowhere; the honesty audit is a *verifier*, not a prohibition.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-06

Initial research base for the 𝔽₁-square / Riemann Hypothesis program.

### Added
- `F1Square.lean` — Lean 4 formalization of the target object
  `Spec ℤ ×_{𝔽₁} Spec ℤ` and its intersection theory, in the `UOR.Bridge.F1Square`
  namespace. Encodes each result's honest epistemic status: verified/classical results
  carry their established status (`universallyValid := some true`); the RH crux (the
  Hodge index theorem) is encoded as not-asserted (`universallyValid := none`) and is
  **never** asserted true. Includes the `F1SquareStatus` roll-up record.
- `docs/` — the three research documents that this formalization companions:
  - `f1_square_intersection_theory.md` — precise specification of the target object,
    the candidate-construction gap table, the named obstructions, and the T1–T5
    verification ladder.
  - `missing_object_over_Q.md` — the four equivalent solution routes and the
    `λₙ` / Hodge-index convergence map.
  - `characteristic_1_constructions.md` — the verified characteristic-1 / tropical
    stack (R1–R16) supplying the 1-dimensional arithmetic-site curve.
- Lake project: `lakefile.lean`, `lean-toolchain` (`leanprover/lean4:v4.16.0`), and
  `lake-manifest.json` pinning the `uor` dependency to UOR-Framework **v0.5.2**
  (`392c7f91e202cf7d119997ac14497444416ed2ce`) — the latest UOR-Framework release that
  ships the `lean4/` library. `lake build` compiles cleanly against this pin.
- Repository infrastructure: `README.md`, `CITATION.cff`, this changelog, `.gitignore`,
  and a GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs `lake build`.

### Notes
- The Riemann Hypothesis remains **open**. This release builds the research *base*, not a
  solution: the formalization compiles and states the construction problem precisely; it
  does not assert the crux.
